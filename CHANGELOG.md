# Changelog

## v3.3.0 (2026-05-30) — public Facts seeder + install wiring

**The problem.** An empty Phase 3 Facts table is a trap. Recall (fuzzy) and
Facts (exact) answer different questions, but when no canonical Fact exists, a
stale session-log memory wins a lookup it should lose — an agent "remembers" an
old model name or a retired port because nothing contradicted it. Every operator
hits this; the fix (seed the truths you already know at `confidence=verified`)
existed only as private Project Sparks tooling.

**What changed (additive — new `tools/`, no service-code behavior change):**
- `tools/seed-facts.py` — generalized loader. Reads a YAML of
  `(entity, attribute, value)` claims and asserts each as a Fact. Idempotent:
  re-runs skip matches, report contradictions, and write nothing in `--dry-run`.
  Runs on the bundled `httpx` + `pyyaml` (no new deps). Local-first
  (`MNEMO_URL` default `http://127.0.0.1:50001`); optional `MNEMO_AUTH_TOKEN`
  sent as `X-API-KEY` for auth-enforcing (non-loopback) deployments.
- `tools/seed-facts.example.yaml` — worked example with generic role names,
  including the high-value "retired entity" supersession pattern.
- `tools/seed-facts-post-commit.sh` + `tools/seed-facts-nightly.sh` — opt-in git
  post-commit hook and nightly cron that re-seed when the YAML changes.
  Self-contained, env-configurable, no scheduler assumptions.
- `tools/README.md` — quick start, env reference, idempotency/conflict notes.
- `robot.install` gains a `facts_seed` block (disabled by default). When
  enabled, `robot-install.sh` runs the seeder after the smoke test and can
  install the post-commit hook and/or nightly cron. Best-effort: a seeding
  hiccup is reported in its own `facts_seed` step but never fails the install.
- `robot.info` / `llms.txt` refreshed: version bumped to match the package
  (the manifest had drifted to 3.1.0), `facts_seed` documented in the install
  block, a new common-question on seeding, `pyyaml` added to the dependency list.

## v3.2.0 (2026-05-29) — dreamer: opt-in git-sync wedge

**The problem.** The nightly Dreamer runs `mnemo-dream.py` from a checkout on
the host machine. Two drift modes are invisible to it: (1) the Dreamer's own
checkout going stale or divergent from the repo (this actually happened — a
checkout drifted 35 commits behind with uncommitted local edits, so the live
Dreamer silently lacked features that had shipped), and (2) a brain/plan repo
edited on one machine but never pushed, so the next machine pulls stale state.
The facts seeder closes recall-side drift but can't see git state.

**What changed (additive, opt-in, default-off):**
- New `check_git_sync()` in `mnemo-dream.py` reports, per watched repo, whether
  the working tree is dirty, has unpushed commits, or is behind its upstream.
  Upstream is resolved via `@{u}` so it works whether the branch tracks
  `origin/main` or `origin/master`.
- Watched repos default to the Dreamer's own checkout plus the brain repo when
  `BRAIN_DIR` is set; `MNEMO_DREAM_GIT_SYNC_REPOS` (comma-separated paths)
  overrides.
- Results are always logged and appended to the printed dream report; drift
  (any `⚠️`) is also pushed to the bus + Discord webhook via `notify_git_sync()`,
  mirroring the existing `notify_contradictions` best-effort contract. Clean
  nights stay quiet.
- Gated behind `MNEMO_DREAM_GIT_SYNC_CHECK` (`1`/`true`/`yes`). Fully
  best-effort: every git call is timeout-bounded and exception-guarded, so the
  check can never crash the dream run.

**Scope note.** Each checkout only sees its *own* local git state. An
artforge-side check catches "behind remote" and that host's own dirty/unpushed
state; catching another machine's *uncommitted* edits requires running the
check on that machine too. No server/API change — Dreamer script only.

## v3.1.3 (2026-05-28) — auth: clients authenticate with `MNEMO_AUTH_TOKEN`

Defense-in-depth on top of network controls (firewall / loopback bind). The
auth middleware already shipped — when `server.auth_token` is set, every
endpoint except `/health` requires the token via either `X-API-KEY` or
`Authorization: Bearer`. This release teaches the bundled clients to send it,
so token enforcement can be enabled without breaking the mesh.

**Clients now send the token (opt-in — silent when no token is present):**
- **MCP bridge** (`integrations/mcp-bridge/server.js`) — reads
  `MNEMO_AUTH_TOKEN` from env, else `~/.mnemo-auth-token` (mode 0600), and
  sends it as `X-API-KEY` on every request. Reading from a single dotfile
  keeps the secret out of each agent's MCP config.
- **Dreamer** (`mnemo-dream.py`) — sends the token on its `/writeback` and
  `/facts` calls.

**Enabling auth (safe rollout):** clients can be configured to *send* the
token before the server *requires* it — an unset `server.auth_token` ignores
the header. Once all clients are sending, set `server.auth_token`
(e.g. `auth_token: ${MNEMO_AUTH_TOKEN}`) and restart. Rollback is a one-line
config removal plus restart.

## v3.1.2 (2026-05-28) — hardening: batch/live breaker isolation, body-size guard, requirements pin

Three hardening fixes surfaced by a security review.

**1. Batch writes no longer share the live embedding circuit breaker.**
The nightly dreamer (`mnemo-dream.py`) POSTs its synthesized memory to
`/writeback`, which embedded through the same `ResilientEmbedding.embed()`
— and the same `CircuitBreaker` — that guards the live `/context` read
path. A large or failing batch could trip the breaker (poisoning live
reads for the cooldown window) or be blocked by an already-open one. This
is the exact batch-vs-live breaker-sharing failure we hit once before.
- `ResilientEmbedding.embed()` gains a keyword-only `use_breaker: bool = True`.
  When `False`, it runs the same primary→fallback adaptive chain but never
  consults or mutates the breaker, and never perturbs the provider-health
  flags reported by `/health`.
- `WritebackRequest` gains a `batch: bool = False` field; the `/writeback`
  handler embeds with `use_breaker=not req.batch`.
- The dreamer now sends `batch: true`.

**2. Request body-size guard (DoS).** Added `ServerConfig.max_body_bytes`
(default 16 MiB, `0` disables) and a middleware that rejects oversized
payloads with `413` before they get embedded, indexed, or written to disk.
No legitimate memory write approaches the limit.

**3. `requirements.txt` realigned to `pyproject.toml`.** The stale file
listed `fastapi>=0.104.0` (no `!=0.136.3` exclusion — would resolve to the
MAL-2026-4750 release) and omitted the `sqlite-vec` runtime dep entirely.
Now mirrors `pyproject` with the security pins; `pyproject` remains canonical.

## v3.1.1 (2026-05-25) — Starlette 1.0 refactor + PYSEC-2026-161 pin

**The problem.** PYSEC-2026-161 (Host-header bypass in Starlette < 1.0.1)
shipped with no 0.x backport — the only fix is moving to the 1.x line.
Until now Starlette was a transitive dep through FastAPI with no floor
constraint, so the server could resolve to a vulnerable version. Real-world
exposure is bounded (both deploys are Tailscale-private or localhost), but
the deprecated lifecycle APIs that Starlette 1.x flags would eventually
break us anyway.

**What changed:**
- `pyproject.toml`: added explicit `starlette>=1.0.1` dependency. Closes
  the resolver gap where the security pin could be bypassed by anything
  installed alongside.
- `agentb/server.py`: migrated `@app.on_event("startup")` (deprecated in
  Starlette 1.x, removed in a future release) to the FastAPI lifespan
  asynccontextmanager pattern. The startup banner and the
  `maintenance_loop()` task launcher moved into the new `lifespan()`
  closure inside `create_app()`. The conditional `@app.middleware("http")`
  auth decorator was left untouched — it still works under Starlette 1.1.0
  without warnings. CORS middleware likewise stays on `app.add_middleware`.

**Verified before deploy.** Throwaway venv with `starlette==1.1.0`,
`fastapi==0.135.1`: `create_app()` returns clean under
`-W error::DeprecationWarning`, lifespan fires the banner on TestClient
startup, `/health` returns 200, and all 106 existing tests pass.

No HTTP API or MCP tool signatures changed. The `/health` endpoint now
reports `"version": "3.1.1"`.

## v3.1.0 (2026-05-23) — Mem0 bridge retired

The optional Mem0 cloud-deep fallback path has been removed. Mnemo Cortex
is now local-first only — no cloud memory fallback. This was an opt-in
feature off by default since the bridge shipped; no deployment had it
enabled in production. Removed code paths are preserved in git history
and the bridge module is retained at `agentb/mem0_bridge.py.retired-20260523`
per the archive-don't-delete doctrine.

**Why:** Mnemo's local performance (sub-100ms recall, 80% compaction
ratio, cross-agent dreaming) made the comparison race unnecessary. The
"and Mem0, not instead of Mem0" framing no longer matches the project's
direction.

**What changed:**
- `agentb/server.py`: removed conditional `from agentb.mem0_bridge import Mem0Bridge` block and the two MEM0 retrieval/write blocks in `/context` and `/writeback` endpoints. `cache_hits["MEM0"]` no longer appears in `/context` responses.
- `agentb/config.py`: removed `Mem0Config` dataclass, `AgentConfig.mem0_user_id` + `.mem0_fallback_only` fields, `AgentBConfig.mem0` field, `resolve_mem0()` function, and the corresponding load-time mappings. Any `mem0:` block in `~/.agentb/config.json` is now silently ignored.
- `agentb/mem0_bridge.py`: renamed to `agentb/mem0_bridge.py.retired-20260523`.
- `mnemo-dream.py`: log message updated from "L2 + Mem0" to "L2" to reflect single-target writeback.
- `README.md`, `llms.txt`: removed "Works with Mem0" section, Mem0 Bridge feature row, and `└── Mem0 Bridge` line from architecture diagram. Inspirations section keeps the Mem0 acknowledgment as historical credit. Competitor-comparison statements (Mem0/Zep/Letta) stay.

No HTTP API or MCP tool signatures changed. Existing clients see identical
request/response shapes minus the optional `cache_hits["MEM0"]` key.

## v3.0.0 (2026-05-21) — Version rebrand: v2.12.0 → v3.0.0

No code changes. This release re-tags what shipped as `v2.12.0` (Phase 3
Facts + Confidence, embedding hosted fallback, Dreamer rehab) as `v3.0.0`
to align with the public announcement.

The server app version (formerly tracked independently as `0.8.0`) is
unified with the package version starting here — both are now `3.0.0`.
README header and health-output examples updated to match.

See the v2.12.0 entry below for the full feature set in this release.

## v2.12.0 (2026-05-20) — Phase 3 Facts + Confidence, Embedding hosted fallback, Dreamer rehab

Three meaningful additions in one release. Server app version bumps from
`0.7.0` to `0.8.0`.

### Phase 3 — Structured Facts Table + Three-State Confidence

**The gap this closes.** Mnemo today treats every memory as text+tags
retrieved by FTS5 or vector similarity. That's the right tool for "what
did we decide about X" — fuzzy recall over prose. It's the wrong tool
for "what is the agent's location?" That's a key-value lookup
pretending to be a search. The Peter Widget name-recall failure was the
canonical case: a structured fact lookup got routed through semantic
search and returned wrong answers because the stored words didn't
overlap the query.

Facts also need confidence. Today a verified-from-source claim and a
hallucinated guess look identical in storage. When recall returns hits,
callers can't tell which are solid. Discord-architecture flip-flops
(three contradictory claims, all stated with equal confidence) become
invisible.

**What ships.**

- New SQLite store at `~/.agentb/facts.sqlite` (shared global, WAL mode).
  Two tables: `facts` (composite PK `(entity, attribute)`, one current
  value per pair) and `fact_history` (append-only audit log of every
  change). Schema auto-creates on connect — `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
  on every connection so the file can be deleted/recreated without a
  service restart.
- Three-state confidence: `verified > high_probability > false`.
  Promotion ladder enforced — `verified` only overwritten by another
  `verified` (with audit trail), lower confidence rejected if existing
  is higher.
- Six new HTTP routes: `GET /facts/{entity}/{attribute}`,
  `GET /facts?entity=&attribute=&value_contains=&confidence=`,
  `POST /facts`, `POST /facts/demote`,
  `GET /facts/history/{entity}/{attribute}`, `GET /facts/contradictions`.
- Four new MCP bridge tools: `mnemo_fact_get`, `mnemo_fact_query`,
  `mnemo_fact_save`, `mnemo_fact_demote`. The demote tool exists because
  the promotion ladder otherwise blocks `verified → false` transitions
  when the correct replacement value isn't yet known.
- Evidence source uses a prefix convention for pseudo-structure without
  schema enforcement: `memory:<id>`, `commit:<sha>`,
  `file:<path>:<line>`, `statement:<who>`, `bus:#<id>`, `dream:<date>`,
  `contradicted_by:<source>`.

**Dreamer Stage 0.5 — automated fact extraction.** Nightly Dreamer gains
a stage between harvest and synthesis that calls the LLM with a strict
conservative-only-direct-statements prompt to extract `(entity, attribute,
value)` triples and POST them to `/facts` with
`confidence='high_probability'`. Auto-capture entries (bridge captureCall
flushes, JSONL sync messages) are filtered before extraction — they're
tool-call logs, not stated facts. Conservative extraction is load-bearing
(not a tuning knob); loosening to inferred relationships is a deliberate
later decision driven by measured false-positive data.

**Contradiction notification.** When Stage 0.5 extracts a fact that
conflicts with an existing `verified` fact, the spec's promotion ladder
correctly rejects the overwrite — but silent rejection means
contradictions pile up and nobody reviews them. v2.12.0 batches all
per-run verified-vs-extracted conflicts and posts at end of Dreamer run
to two optional channels (both opt-in via env vars, both gracefully skip
when unset):

- Bus message via HTTP to a busmaster/dispatcher of your choice.
  Requires `MNEMO_DREAM_BUS_URL` + `MNEMO_DREAM_BUS_FROM` (registered
  sender agent name) + `MNEMO_DREAM_BUS_TARGETS` (comma-separated
  registered receivers). Envelope shape matches the
  `github.com/GuyMannDude/disco-bus` mesh spec.
- Discord webhook via `MNEMO_DREAM_DISCORD_WEBHOOK`. Direct human
  visibility without waiting for an agent to surface.

One batched message per cron run, never per-contradiction. Quiet nights
produce no notification.

**Cost.** Stage 0.5 adds one LLM call per agent per night to the
Dreamer pipeline. Per-night dream cost roughly doubles from $0.0013 to
$0.003 — still rounding error.

**Tests.** 23 new unit tests in `tests/test_facts_store.py` covering
happy paths, normalization, all promotion-ladder branches, demotion
edge cases, query filters, and persistence.

### Embedding hosted fallback

`agentb/providers.py:GoogleEmbedding.embed()` now reads
`self.config.extra.output_dimensionality` and passes it through. This
enables a fully working hosted fallback for the local Ollama embedding
primary: Google's `gemini-embedding-001` outputs 3072 dims natively but
supports Matryoshka truncation. Configure the fallback with
`extra.output_dimensionality: 768` to match the locked sqlite-vec store
width without dim-guard trips. See `agentb.yaml.example` for the full
shape. Closes the "if Ollama dies, every Mnemo recall 500s" gap flagged
in v2.11.5 task notes.

### Dreamer pipeline rehab

`mnemo-dream.py` had been silently dark since 2026-05-13 due to three
cascading failure modes — token explosion (4000+ accumulated memories
sent to gemini-2.5-flash as one prompt = ~6M tokens, model caps at 1M);
env file gap during the v2.10.0 cutover; and a path mismatch where the
script read from `~/.agentb/memory/<agent>/` (pre-cutover layout) but
memories had moved to `~/.agentb/agents/<agent>/memory/` (current
layout). v2.12.0 fixes all three:

- Path migration: harvest walks the current `~/.agentb/agents/<agent>/memory/`
  layout. Agent auto-discovery enumerates the directory at runtime;
  `MNEMO_DREAM_AGENTS` env var pins a specific list for installs that
  want explicit control.
- Two-stage map-reduce synthesis: per-agent partial summary first
  (cheap), then joint cross-agent rollup of summaries (also cheap).
  Per-call token usage is bounded; the 1M-context limit is never
  approached regardless of corpus size.

### Other

- `mnemo-cortex 0.8.0` server app version (was 0.7.0).
- Agent list in `MNEMO_DREAM_AGENTS` and bus envelope `MNEMO_DREAM_BUS_FROM`/
  `MNEMO_DREAM_BUS_TARGETS` are explicit env vars rather than hardcoded.

## v2.11.5 (2026-05-19) — Adaptive truncation on live recall (input-too-long != provider down)

**Problem.** Opie reported intermittent 503s from `mnemo_recall` / `mnemo_search`
on cross-agent search: `Embedding unavailable: All embedding providers failed
(primary + all fallbacks)`. Writes succeeded; only recall flapped. He
suspected Ollama was crashing or overloaded.

Diagnostics on artforge ruled that out — Ollama healthy (up 1d10h, peak 1GB,
GPU idle), nomic-embed-text loaded and responding instantly. The smoking gun
was in `journalctl -u ollama`: a rapid-fire burst of HTTP 400s clustered at
Opie's exact session time, with reason `llm embedding error: the input
length exceeds the context length`. Same class of bug v2.11.3 fixed for
the backfill path — but the live recall path had no equivalent shield.

**Root cause.** `ResilientEmbedding.embed()` (`agentb/providers.py`) treated
a 400 (input too long) the same as a 503 (provider down):

1. Primary 400s on oversized input.
2. Wrapper records a circuit-breaker failure (wrong — provider is fine).
3. Walks the fallback chain. Each fallback receives the same oversized
   input and also 400s with the same length error.
4. Final: `RuntimeError("All embedding providers failed")`, which the
   `/context` endpoint surfaces as a 503 to the caller.

The wrapper conflated input-property errors with provider-state errors.
v2.11.3's `embed_with_adaptive_truncation` solved this for backfill at the
call-site level; v2.11.5 lifts the same idea into the resilient wrapper so
all 8 `embedder.embed()` call sites in `server.py` (`/context`, `/preflight`,
`/writeback`, persona archive, etc.) get the fix for free.

**Fix.** `agentb/providers.py`:

- New `ResilientEmbedding._try_embed_adaptive(provider, text)`: invokes one
  provider, halves the input on HTTP 400 down to a 500-char floor, retries
  on the same provider. Re-raises anything that isn't a 400, or a 400 below
  the floor.
- `ResilientEmbedding.embed(text)` now calls `_try_embed_adaptive` for the
  primary and for each fallback. Halving stays on a single provider (it's
  an input issue, not a provider issue) and **does not record a circuit-
  breaker failure** for input-too-long. Real provider failures (503, timeout,
  connection refused, etc.) still failover and still trip the breaker.

**Why it lives in the wrapper, not at each call site:** every server-side
embed path benefits without per-site changes, and the wrapper is the
correct place to decide "is this a property of the input or a property of
the provider." Putting the logic at call sites would have meant patching 8
places and remembering to patch the 9th.

**Tests** (`tests/test_agentb.py::TestResilientEmbedding`):

- `test_400_halves_and_succeeds_on_primary` — primary 400s once, halves,
  succeeds. No failover.
- `test_400_does_not_trip_circuit_breaker` — three 400-then-recover cycles
  do not open the breaker.
- `test_400_at_min_chars_falls_over_to_fallback` — primary 400s even at
  the floor, fallback handles it.
- `test_non_400_error_is_provider_failure` — a 503 on primary fails over
  immediately (one call, no halving).

All 6 ResilientEmbedding tests green; 95/96 in the full agentb suite (the
one failure is in `tests/passport/test_validation.py`, pre-existing,
unrelated to the embedder).

**Deploy.** Pull on artforge's `mnemo-cortex-stage` (same branch); restart
`mnemo-cortex.service`. The bridge on each agent is unaffected.

## v2.11.4 (2026-05-19) — Session IDs in host-local time, not UTC

**Problem.** Session IDs were generated with `new Date().toISOString()` and
the date prefix was stamped from that UTC string. Every other timestamp the
agents write — `active.md` dates, brain commit messages, kickstart filenames
— uses host-local time (America/Los_Angeles for IGOR + artforge). The
session ID was the sole exception. After 17:00 PT the UTC date has already
rolled to "tomorrow," producing IDs like `opie-2026-05-20-00-22-53` while
the rest of the brain still says `2026-05-19`. Opie spotted the drift mid-
session.

**Fix.** `integrations/mcp-bridge/server.js` — added `localTimestamp()` and
`localDateOnly()` helpers near the `sessionId` declaration; replaced all
four UTC-derived call sites:

- Line ~640 — `mnemo_save` session_id fallback
- Line ~741 — session bootstrap (the primary site)
- Line ~1098 — `session_end` session_id fallback
- Line ~1129 — brain commit message date

Format unchanged (`YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS`), so existing consumers treat new
IDs identically to old ones. Old IDs in the Mnemo store stay as-is; this
is a forward-only correction.

**Deploy.** Every agent picks up the fix on its next restart of the bridge
process: CC at next `claude` session start, Opie at next full Claude Desktop
quit + relaunch, Rocky at next `hermes` launch, nurse on artforge after
`systemctl --user restart` of its bridge unit. No artforge-side mnemo
service changes — this is bridge-local.

## v2.11.3 (2026-05-16) — Adaptive truncation + circuit-breaker bypass on backfill

Two more failure modes surfaced during the artforge deploy of v2.11.0–2:

1. **Static caps don't fit token-dense content.** v2.11.1 capped backfill
   input at 6000 chars; v2.11.2 dropped that to 4000 after 6000 still 400'd
   on opie's path-heavy wiki FILE INDEX batches. Even 4000 fails on some
   entries (long UUID-laden URIs tokenize at ~1 char/token). 3000 worked on
   the worst observed cases. But a constant cap will always be wrong for
   *some* content — the right answer is adaptive retry.

2. **Backfill shared the embedder's circuit breaker with live `/context`
   queries.** When three consecutive 400s tripped the breaker mid-backfill,
   every subsequent embed call — including for live recall — was skipped
   instantly until the 60s cooldown elapsed. Backfill was poisoning the
   service it was meant to upgrade.

This release fixes both:

- **`agentb/vec.py`** — `embed_with_adaptive_truncation()` catches HTTP 400
  from the embed call and retries with input halved (down to a 500-char
  floor). Returns the vector AND the text that was actually embedded so
  `vec_sources.text` stays consistent with the vector. Backfill uses it by
  default (`adaptive=True`); tests can flip it off when using synthetic
  embedders that don't raise httpx errors.
- **`agentb/server.py`** — `/vec/backfill` now passes `embedder.primary.embed`
  rather than the resilient wrapper. Per-entry failures stay per-entry; the
  shared circuit breaker is never touched by backfill, so a long batch over
  heterogeneous content can no longer poison live recall.
- **`agentb/vec.py`** — backfill stats now include a `truncated` counter so
  the response and logs report how many entries needed adaptive halving.
- **`tests/test_vec.py`** — four new tests cover the halving behavior, the
  500-char min-floor giveup, propagation of non-400 errors, and the
  truncated-counter accounting through `backfill()`.

**Production result.** After this release the artforge opie tenant backfills
cleanly — adaptive truncation eats the dense entries, no circuit breaker
flips, live queries unaffected.


## v2.11.2 (2026-05-16) — Drop backfill input cap to 4000 chars (superseded)

Follow-up to v2.11.1. The 6000-char cap still 400'd on production data:
opie's wiki FILE INDEX BATCH entries are path-heavy (long file URIs +
UUIDs + hashes), and that content tokenizes much denser than typical
English prose. A 6000-char input produced more tokens than nomic-embed
-text's 2048-token window could hold, so the same circuit-breaker
cascade re-occurred. Direct test confirmed 4000 chars succeeds where
6000 fails on the same entries. Dropping the cap to 4000.

Superseded same day by v2.11.3, which moved from "pick the right constant"
to "adapt per entry" and isolated the failure surface from live queries.


## v2.11.1 (2026-05-16) — Backfill survives oversize memory entries

Discovered during the artforge deploy of v2.11.0. The `opie` tenant has
auto-generated "FILE INDEX BATCH" memories — wiki-ingest output with 30
file paths per entry, several thousand to seventeen thousand characters
of text. nomic-embed-text accepts ~2048 tokens and returns HTTP 400 on
anything past that. Five consecutive 400s trip the embedder's circuit
breaker, and the rest of the backfill (2663 of 2666 entries for opie)
fails instantly without an embedding even being attempted.

This patch caps `iter_memory_entries`' text output at
`MAX_EMBED_INPUT_CHARS = 6000` (a safe margin under nomic's actual
context length) and emits a per-entry warning when truncation happens.
The truncated text is what gets stored in `vec_sources.text` so the
source row stays consistent with the vector. The lost tail of a 17 k
character file-index batch is mostly redundant path prefixes — a
6 k-char prefix retains enough signal for semantic recall.

This is a backfill-side fix. `/writeback` already wraps its embed call
in a try/except that downgrades to a warning, so live writes degrade
gracefully on oversize input rather than 5xx'ing the caller. A future
release will lift truncation into the embedding provider so writeback
and backfill share the same cap.

**Production result.** Re-ran the artforge backfill: rocky 168/168,
cc 1411/1411, opie 2666/2666. All three tenants now have a complete
vec index. Total Ollama wall time across all three agents ~5 minutes.

- `agentb/vec.py` — `MAX_EMBED_INPUT_CHARS` constant + truncation in
  `iter_memory_entries` with per-entry warning log.
- `tests/test_vec.py` — `test_iter_memory_entries_truncates_oversize`
  asserts the cap is applied and the warning fires.


## v2.11.0 (2026-05-16) — sqlite-vec vector index (Mnemo v4 Phase 2)

Before this release, vector recall was a linear scan. Every `/context`
call read every memory bundle from disk, computed cosine similarity in
Python, and ranked the result. At 1,398 production memories the L1/L2/L3
chain works; at 14,000 it doesn't. The index needed to live next to the
memories, not be rebuilt from JSON on every read.

This release adds an indexed sqlite-vec table per agent. The existing
L1 (project precache) and L2/L3 (linear scans) tiers stay — the new VEC
tier slots between them and answers semantic recall in milliseconds even
on the full corpus.

**What's new in `agentb/`.**

- **`agentb/vec.py`** — new module. `VecStore` wraps a per-tenant SQLite
  file with two tables: `vec_sources(memory_id, text, source_file, created_at)`
  and `vec_embeddings USING vec0(memory_id, embedding FLOAT[768])`. Source
  text and vectors are stored separately so the embedding index is
  rebuildable without touching memory bundles (Open Brain's
  source/vector separation principle). Dimension is locked to 768 —
  matched to `nomic-embed-text`, the default primary embedder. A vector
  of the wrong dimension raises `VecDimMismatch` and refuses the write
  rather than silently dropping data; loud failure beats silent vector
  loss (Vapor Truth doctrine).
- **`agentb/vec.py`** — auto-detected operating modes. `detect_mode(memory_dir)`
  returns `migration` when JSON entries already live on disk and `clean`
  otherwise. Existing installs upgrade in place: their bundles stay as
  the source of truth and a one-shot backfill populates the vec index.
  Fresh installs initialize empty. The user never picks a mode.
- **`agentb/vec.py`** — `backfill(store, memory_dir, embed)` walks the
  memory directory, re-embeds canonical `summary + key_facts` text per
  bundle, and upserts into the vec index. Idempotent (skips already-indexed
  ids) and tolerant (continues past per-entry embedding failures and
  malformed files). Returns counters for `total / embedded / skipped /
  failed / elapsed_sec`.
- **`agentb/server.py`** — `TenantManager` now constructs a `VecStore` at
  `<data_dir>/vec_index.sqlite` for every agent and records the detected
  mode. `/writeback` reuses the embedding it already computed for the L2
  tier and upserts it into the vec index in the same transaction. The
  `/context` pipeline gains a VEC tier between L1 and L2 — when the vec
  index has data, the query embedding runs against vec0's k-NN, hits are
  wrapped as `ContextChunk(cache_tier="VEC")`, and `cache_hits["VEC"]`
  surfaces in the response. L2/L3 still run when VEC doesn't return
  enough chunks; nothing else in the chain changed.
- **`agentb/server.py`** — `GET /vec/status?agent_id=X` reports mode,
  indexed count, on-disk memory count, and db path for the tenant.
  `POST /vec/backfill?agent_id=X` runs the backfill walk on demand and
  returns the stats dict. Use this once on upgrade for existing installs;
  dreaming can call it nightly for ongoing maintenance.
- **`pyproject.toml`** — adds `sqlite-vec>=0.1.6` as a runtime dependency.
- **`tests/test_vec.py`** — new test module. Sixteen tests cover store
  init, upsert/replace/delete, dimension-guard rejection (write and
  query paths), mode detection across empty / json-present / missing
  directories, `iter_memory_entries` (canonical text shape, empties
  skipped, corrupt files tolerated), backfill (single-pass, idempotent,
  failure-tolerant), and the spec's canonical semantic-over-keyword
  scenario.

**Verified on the production corpus.** Backfilled 1,398 cc-agent memory
bundles in 86.5s (~62 ms/entry, Ollama-bound) and observed vec0 k-NN
queries returning top-3 in 3–4 ms over the full set. The same query
shape against the legacy linear-scan path touches every bundle on every
call.

**Upgrade path.** `pip install --upgrade mnemo-cortex`, restart, then
`POST /vec/backfill?agent_id=<your-agent>` once. The vec index appears
alongside `memory/` inside each agent data directory. Memory bundles
stay where they are. Nothing else changes for the user.


## v2.10.0 (2026-05-16) — Provenance & decay land in the open-source core

The MCP bridge announced provenance & decay support back in v2.8.0, but
the Python core that stores memories never received the matching code.
Internal deployments ran a hand-maintained fork while the published
package shipped a pre-provenance backend. Bridge sent the fields, the
backend ignored them.

This release closes that gap. One source of truth.

**What's new in `agentb/`.**

- **`agentb/provenance.py`** — new module. `VALID_SOURCES`,
  `VALID_CATEGORIES`, `DECAY_THRESHOLDS`, `DEFAULT_HIDDEN_CATEGORIES`, the
  regex `PROVENANCE_PATTERNS`, `suggest_category(text)`, and
  `compute_stale_warning(category, created_at)`.
- **`agentb/server.py`** — `WritebackRequest` adopts `source`, `category`,
  `additional_tags`. `WritebackResponse` returns `category_used`,
  `category_suggested`, `category_match_keywords`, `source_used`.
  `ContextRequest` adopts `source`, `category`, `exclude_categories`,
  `exclude_stale`, `max_age_days` filters. `ContextChunkResponse` surfaces
  `provenance_source`, `category`, `additional_tags`, `age_days`,
  `stale_warning`. Writeback runs the regex auto-suggester when no
  category is given and persists `schema_version: 3` on every record.
  `keep_chunk()` applies the filter set across HOT/L1/L2/L3 with 3× over-
  fetch so post-filter trims don't leave callers short. `session_log` is
  hidden by default — pass `exclude_categories=[]` to disable.
- **`agentb/cache.py`** — `ContextChunk` gains optional v3 fields. `L2`
  search reads `metadata.provenance_source` / `metadata.category` /
  `metadata.additional_tags` and computes `age_days` + `stale_warning` per
  chunk. `l3_scan()` does the same straight off the memory_entry record.
- **`agentb/config.py`** — `AgentConfig` adds `mem0_user_id` and
  `mem0_fallback_only` overrides. New `resolve_mem0(cfg, agent_id)` helper
  routes per-agent Mem0 traffic. Two common shapes — agents sharing a
  Mem0 user namespace, or each agent owning its own — both expressible
  in `agentb.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  agents:
    primary-agent:
      mem0_user_id: primary
      mem0_fallback_only: false   # always query Mem0 alongside local
    secondary-agent:
      mem0_user_id: shared        # writes/reads against the same Mem0 user
      mem0_fallback_only: true    # only hit Mem0 when local misses
    tertiary-agent:
      mem0_user_id: shared
      mem0_fallback_only: true
  ```

**Backward compatibility.** Old records (no v3 fields on disk) load
without issue — `keep_chunk` treats unset fields as "pass" when no filter
is active. Old callers that don't pass v3 params on writeback get
`source: inferred` + the auto-suggested category. The on-disk field name
`provenance_source` in L2 metadata stays as it is — no migration script
needed. Strict source filter (`source=user`) drops pre-v3 chunks on
purpose: they have no provenance to evaluate.

**Decay thresholds (days).** Topology warns at 30, stale at 90.
current_state and unknown warn at 90. Relationship warns at 180.
session_log warns at 90. Doctrine, incident, identity, decision are
perpetual — never stale. Override via env: `MNEMO_DECAY_TOPOLOGY_WARN_DAYS`,
`MNEMO_DECAY_RELATIONSHIP_WARN_DAYS`, etc.

**FastAPI app version** bumps to `0.7.0` (`agentb/server.py`); package
version (`pyproject.toml`) bumps to `2.10.0` to match.

**`mnemo_v2/` retired.** The repo previously carried a parallel
conversation-archive product under `mnemo_v2/` — SQLite + FTS5 over
message transcripts with leaf/condensed summary compaction. It never
shared callers with the memory engine in `agentb/`: nothing imported
from it, `install.sh` didn't deploy it, the MCP bridge didn't route to
it, and `tests/test_smoke.py` was its only consumer. Two parallel
servers under one repo confused readers about which path was "the"
backend. Removed (`mnemo_v2/`, `tests/test_smoke.py`, the deprecated
`integrations/claude-code/mnemo-watcher-cc.sh` shim that targeted it,
plus the `pyproject.toml` and `scripts/wheel-smoke-test.sh` references).
If conversation compaction is wanted in the future, building it on
`agentb/` directly is simpler than maintaining a parallel server.

## v2.9.0 (2026-05-15) — Developer Dump (Mnemo v4 Phase 1)

First piece of the Mnemo v4 roadmap. Adds bridge-level JSONL capture of
every MCP tool call across all agents that route through the shared MCP
bridge (CC, Opie, Rocky, Hermes, Claude Desktop, anything else). Default
**off** — no surprise data collection for public users. Flip on with one
env var.

**Problem this solves.** When a tool call silently fails (Peter Widget
went dark for hours and nobody noticed), there's no trace to look at. The
bridge knew every detail of what happened — tool name, params, response,
latency, success/failure — and threw it all away. Same loss when you want
training data, a debugging trail, or to understand why an agent
flip-flopped three times on the same answer.

**What ships.** A new `dump.js` module in the MCP bridge that wraps every
tool handler with a writer. One monkey-patch on `server.registerTool`
covers all 18 existing tools and any future additions. Output is JSONL,
one file per agent per day, human-greppable with `jq`:

```bash
# Turn it on for your bridge
export MNEMO_DUMP=on
# (optional) custom dir, default ~/.mnemo-cortex/dumps
export MNEMO_DUMP_DIR=~/dumps
```

```jsonl
{"ts":"2026-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","kind":"header","schema_version":1,"mnemo_version":"2.9.0","agent_id":"rocky"}
{"schema_version":1,"ts":"2026-05-15T20:14:33.123Z","kind":"tool_call","agent_id":"rocky","tool":"mnemo_save","params":{...},"response":{...},"latency_ms":47,"ok":true}
{"schema_version":1,"ts":"...","kind":"tool_call","agent_id":"rocky","tool":"mnemo_recall","params":{...},"response":null,"latency_ms":12,"ok":false,"error":"ECONNREFUSED"}
```

**Failure capture.** Handlers in the bridge catch internally and return
`{isError: true}` instead of throwing — the dump still records those as
`ok: false` with the error message extracted from the response text. Real
thrown errors are also captured and then re-thrown unchanged.

**Fail-loud on write errors.** If the dump directory becomes unwritable
(disk full, permission flip), the writer logs `[MNEMO DUMP FAIL]` to
stderr once per failure streak. Tool dispatch keeps working — the dump
never breaks the bridge.

**CLI for inspection** (server-side, via `mnemo-cortex`):

```bash
mnemo-cortex dump list                  # all dump files, size + line count
mnemo-cortex dump tail rocky            # live-tail today's rocky dump
mnemo-cortex dump tail rocky --no-follow # one-shot print
```

**Zero overhead when off.** `dump.wrap()` returns the original handler
unchanged when `MNEMO_DUMP=off` (the default). No allocation, no closure,
no measurable cost.

**Schema versioning.** Every line carries `schema_version: 1`. Future
Phase 1.5+ additions (per-agent message capture, custom content filters)
will bump the schema cleanly.

**Tests:** 10 new tests in `dump.test.js`, all passing — covers off-mode
no-op, on-mode header+event, two-agent isolation, day rollover, write-
failure handling, success capture, isError capture, thrown-error capture,
disabled passthrough, and `listDumps()`. Runs without a Mnemo server.

**Scope discipline.** Phase 1 only captures what the bridge sees — MCP
tool traffic. Agent-side messages (user prompts, agent text responses,
raw Claude API exchanges) live in agent processes and need per-agent
hooks. That's the Phase 1.5 frontier. See
`brain/mnemo-v4-phase1-dump-spec.md` in `sparks-brain-guy` for the design
rationale; bus #223 for the pressure-tests that produced it.

Version alignment: this release also bumps `pyproject.toml` (was 2.7.1)
and the CLI `--version` string (was 2.6.4) to match the CHANGELOG /
bridge versions. They had drifted across the last few releases.

## v2.8.2 (2026-05-15) — Installer hardening (non-interactive + DRY_RUN fixes)

Two installers had bugs that silently broke `curl | bash` and CI workflows.
Found while auditing why a community user reported install trouble.

**Fix 1 — `integrations/hermes/install.sh` hung in non-interactive mode.**

Hermes Agent's `hermes mcp add` (v0.12.0+) prompts *after* tool discovery
with "Enable all N tools? [Y/n/select]". The installer didn't pipe a
response, so any non-TTY run (curl|bash, CI, dotfile bootstrap, restricted
shell) hung there forever — or, on some shells, silently dropped the
config persist step. The user saw "✓ Connected!" and then nothing.

Now: the installer detects `[ -t 0 ]` at startup. In non-interactive mode
it pipes `yes Y` into `hermes mcp add` to auto-accept tool selection,
and honors env vars in place of the interactive prompts:

```bash
MNEMO_URL=http://localhost:50001 \
MNEMO_AGENT_ID=hermes \
MNEMO_SHARE=separate \
MNEMO_REPLACE=1 \
bash install.sh < /dev/null
```

Replace-existing requires explicit `MNEMO_REPLACE=1` in non-interactive
mode rather than silently overwriting a working config. Unreachable
Mnemo aborts loudly instead of wiring Hermes to a dead server.

**Fix 2 — `robot-install.sh` DRY_RUN leaked API keys to disk.**

`MNEMO_INSTALL_DRY_RUN=1` was meant to skip side effects, but step 3
(config + env file + data dirs) was never gated. A user testing the
installer with their real `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` set in the environment
would silently have that key written into
`~/.config/mnemo-cortex/mnemo-cortex.env` (mode 0600). Dry-run with a
real key was a foot-cannon.

Now: step 3 is wrapped in the same `DRY_RUN` guard as steps 2/4/5.
Dry-run reports the paths each step *would* write but produces zero side
effects on disk. Verified with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=test-not-real
MNEMO_INSTALL_DRY_RUN=1 ./robot-install.sh` — no files created.

**Doc fixes alongside.** README clarifies that `robot.install` sets up
the **server only**; agent integrations live under `integrations/`.
Hermes integration README updated for the current 18-tool surface
(was 17 — `agent_startup` got added) and notes that the config entry
lands at `~/.hermes/profiles/<profile>/config.yaml` for profile-using
Hermes setups, not just `~/.hermes/config.yaml`.

## v2.8.1 (2026-05-13) — MCP bridge directory rename

`integrations/openclaw-mcp/` → `integrations/mcp-bridge/`. The bridge
code at the old path was never OpenClaw-specific — it's the generic
Node.js MCP server that every Mnemo Cortex integration (Claude Desktop,
Claude Code, OpenClaw, LM Studio, AnythingLLM, Agent Zero, Hermes Agent,
Ollama Desktop, etc.) spawns on stdio. The old directory name misled
new users; the new path tells the truth.

**Rename-only release. No functional change.** The 8 host-specific
integration directories all had their install scripts + config
examples + READMEs updated to point at the new path. Server.js +
package.json + CHANGELOG + tests moved with `git mv`.

**Back-compat:** the old path `integrations/openclaw-mcp/` is kept as
a thin stub — symlinks at `server.js` and `package.json` resolve to
the new location, plus a README explaining the move. Existing MCP
client configs pointing at the old path keep working without action;
update them at your convenience. Will be removed in a future major
version.

## v2.7.1 (2026-05-04)

Public-release scrub. Mnemo Cortex was developed inside Project Sparks
against a specific multi-agent setup (CC, Rocky, Opie, BW, Cliff, Sparky,
Alice). The source carried that history in defaults, examples, system
prompts, and test fixtures. This release strips the customer/operator/agent
specifics so a fresh user gets a stock/default toolbox they can configure
for their own stack.

### Bridge (integrations/openclaw-mcp, 2.7.0 → 2.7.1)

- **`opie_startup` alias neutralized.** Was hardcoded with a multi-paragraph
  Opie-flavored identity prompt naming a specific operator, machine, and
  team. Now returns a minimal "you ran the deprecated alias, your identity
  lives in opie.md" header. Identity belongs in the brain lane file, not
  in bridge code. The alias still loads opie.md and forces agent_id=opie
  for back-compat — only the static identity block changed.
- **Tool descriptions made generic.** "Sparks Brain directory" → "brain
  directory ($BRAIN_DIR)". `write_brain_file` description no longer names
  specific lane files.

### Synthesis scripts

- **`mnemo-dream.py`**: agent list is now auto-discovered from
  `~/.agentb/memory/<agent>/` subdirectories at runtime. Override with
  `MNEMO_DREAM_AGENTS` env var (comma-separated). System prompt rewritten
  to be agent-agnostic — describes "a multi-agent workspace" without
  naming specific agents or their roles. The agents declare their roles
  through the memories themselves; the synthesizer reads them.
- **`mnemo-wiki-compile.py`**: agent aliases now load from
  `MNEMO_WIKI_AGENT_ALIASES` env var (JSON). Was a hardcoded map of
  Sparks-internal agent names. Discord token / channels paths default to
  `~/.mnemo-cortex/` (was `~/.sparks/`).

### Docs / examples

- **THE-LANE-PROTOCOL.md** task-shape examples now use generic slugs
  (`auth-rate-limit`, `builder`, `architect`) instead of project-specific
  ones (`hoffman-gmc-appeal`, named-agent assignees).
- **`integrations/hermes/README.md`** cross-agent example uses a generic
  "build agent" / "deploy issue" instead of a specific customer/incident.
- **`integrations/openclaw-mcp/README.md`** `MNEMO_AGENT_ID` examples use
  role-shaped names (`assistant`, `builder`, `researcher`).
- **`agentb/recall/parser.py`** docstring example bullets now use
  `@user` / `@builder` instead of named operator/agent.
- **README.md** Origin Story tightened — narrative pointer to
  `FINDING-MNEMO.md` for the full backstory; Credits section keeps the
  contributor list as project history but drops internal-infra
  references.
- **`tests/ongoing/daily-feed.sh`** synthetic test data fully rewritten —
  fictional company, generic agent roles, no real names, locations, or
  customers. The test-questions schema is preserved; only the content
  changed. Stale `tests/ongoing/test-questions.json` removed (the
  generator regenerates it on next run).

### Sparks Bus example agent cards

- Old cards (`bw.json`, `cc.json`, `cliff.json`, `opie.json`, `rocky.json`)
  named specific Sparks-internal agents and infrastructure (Tailscale
  hostnames, internal Discord channels). Replaced with three generic
  cards (`researcher.json`, `builder.json`, `architect.json`) — one per
  delivery method (Discord channel, subprocess, queue/pull). Same A2A
  shape, same Sparks-Bus delivery block format, no real identifiers.
- `sparks_bus/A2A.md` table updated to match.

### Minor

- All `HTTP-Referer` headers in OpenRouter calls now point at the public
  GitHub repo URL instead of the maintainer's personal site.
- `passport/config.py` skeleton example uses `GreenLeaf` (fictional)
  instead of `Hoffman Bedding` (real customer name from origin context).

## v2.6.5 (2026-05-01)

Two install-blocking fixes found while wiring Hermes Agent against the public
package. Both were silent in 2.6.4 — the package installed, but
`mnemo-cortex start` crashed at import time, and even if it had started, the
`--port` flag was dead code.

- **ImportError on startup fixed.** `agentb/server.py` imported `Mem0Config`
  from `agentb.config`, but the class was never defined there and
  `agentb/mem0_bridge.py` was never committed. Result: any fresh
  `pip install mnemo-cortex && mnemo-cortex start` died with
  `ImportError: cannot import name 'Mem0Config' from 'agentb.config'`. The
  Mem0 dataclass + AgentBConfig field + YAML loader + `Mem0Bridge` class are
  now present in the repo. Mem0 is opt-in (`enabled: false` by default), so
  users who don't configure Mem0 simply never trigger the upstream code path.
- **`--port` flag now overrides config.** `mnemo-cortex start --port 50002`
  previously captured the value but never passed it to the server subprocess
  — the bind port came exclusively from `agentb.yaml`'s `server.port`. The
  CLI now exports `MNEMO_PORT` to the subprocess env, and `agentb/server.py`
  honors it as an override over `cfg.server.port`. The yaml stays
  authoritative when the flag is omitted.

No 2.6.4 CHANGELOG entry exists; it shipped as a version bump without a
release note. Anything that landed between 2.6.3 and 2.6.5 is in `git log`.

## v2.6.3 (2026-04-27)

Audit-driven catalog polish (Opie's compliance pass). Two real fixes plus
one nice-to-have, all narrowed from a line-by-line check of the v2.6.2
bundle against the MCPB spec + Connectors Directory submission requirements.

- **`tools_generated: true`** declared in the manifest. The bridge
  conditionally registers up to 8 additional tools at startup based on
  `BRAIN_DIR` / `WIKI_DIR` presence, so the manifest tool list isn't always
  exhaustive. This flag tells reviewers and hosts that's intentional.
- **`tools` array expanded to all 17** with explicit "Conditional (BRAIN_DIR)"
  / "Conditional (WIKI_DIR)" prefixes on the optional ones. Previously the
  manifest declared 9; a reviewer testing on a Sparks-style box would have
  seen 17 and flagged the mismatch.
- **`icons` array** added alongside the existing `icon` string for richer
  catalog rendering. Single 512×512 entry today; room for theme variants
  later without further schema changes.
- Bundle rebuilt; size unchanged (~3.6 MB packed).

No code changes in this release — manifest only, plus the version bump.

---

## v2.6.2 (2026-04-27)

Catalog-grade polish on the Claude Desktop bundle.

- All 17 tool registrations migrated from the deprecated `server.tool(...)`
  signature to `server.registerTool(...)` with proper `annotations`. Every
  tool now declares `title` plus `readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint` /
  `idempotentHint` / `openWorldHint` per the [MCP tool annotations spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/tools#tool-annotations).
  Hosts can now show a clear destructive-action warning before
  `write_brain_file`, `session_end`, and `passport_forget_or_override` fire.
- `manifest.json` declares `privacy_policies` pointing at `PRIVACY.md`.
- New top-level `PRIVACY.md` documents the data flow plainly: bundle talks
  only to the user-configured Mnemo Cortex URL, no telemetry, no third-party
  services unless the user's server is configured that way.
- Claude Desktop README adds a Privacy section.
- Bundle rebuilt with the updated bridge.

These changes meet the requirements for submission to Anthropic's curated
Connectors Directory ([docs](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/building/submission)).

---

## v2.6.1 (2026-04-27)

Bridge surfaces agent attribution again. Mnemo Cortex's `/context` endpoint
returns chunks without an `agent_id` field, so the bridge was always
displaying `agent=?` in cross-agent search results. Now the bridge infers
the agent from the `session:` source string (which is written as
`{AGENT_ID}-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS` since v2.5.0).

- `formatChunks` now derives a tag from `c.source` when `c.agent_id` is
  absent.
- Patterns covered: `session:cc-2026-...`, `session:lmstudio-igor2-2026-...`,
  `session:dream-2026-04-25`. `mem0:*` chunks tag as `mem0`. Anything else
  still falls through as `?`.
- Known limitation: the server-side `agent_id` filter on `/context` is a
  ranking hint, not a strict filter — passing `agent_id=cc` to artforge can
  still return non-cc chunks if they rank highly. That's a Mnemo Cortex
  server issue; the bridge can't fix it. For exact-match retrieval, use
  unique marker phrases in your save content.

---

## v2.6.0 (2026-04-27)

Tools auto-detected based on available directories. Fresh installs see 9
core memory tools.

- **Default tool surface = 9 tools** (4 memory + 5 Passport).
- **Brain-lane + session tools (5)** auto-enable when `BRAIN_DIR` exists
  (default `~/github/sparks-brain-guy/brain`).
- **Wiki tools (3)** auto-enable when `WIKI_DIR` exists (default `~/wiki`).
- No flags, no env-var switches — if the directory is on disk, the tools
  register; if not, they don't.

| Setup | Tools registered |
|---|---|
| Default | **9** — memory + Passport |
| + brain dir | 14 |
| + wiki dir | 12 |
| + both | 17 |

---

## v2.5.0 — "One Bridge" (2026-04-26)

The MCP bridge becomes a single drop-in for every agent. Restores the
brain-lane, wiki, and auto-capture tools that came over from the archived
`mnemo-cortex-mcp` repo, layered on top of the existing Passport + share
bridge. One bridge. Every agent. No more "which server.js do I point at?"

### What Changed

- **Restored 8 tools that were removed in v2.3.0** when Claude Desktop's
  storage architecture forced the integration pull. They're back in the
  unified bridge: `opie_startup`, `read_brain_file`, `list_brain_files`,
  `write_brain_file`, `session_end`, `wiki_search`, `wiki_read`, `wiki_index`.
  The Passport + `mnemo_share` tools introduced in v2.4.x are unchanged.
  Total: 17 tools.
- **Auto-capture + nudge system ported.** Tool calls are buffered (8 entries
  or 2 min idle) and flushed to Mnemo as background activity trail. After
  20 calls without a manual save, responses get a save reminder appended.
  `SIGTERM` / `SIGINT` drain the buffer before exit. Passport tools are
  marked `skip` — their audit lives in passport's git log already.
- **Session ID prefix honors `MNEMO_AGENT_ID`.** CC's saves get `cc-`
  prefix, Rocky's get `rocky-`, Opie's stay `opie-`. The previous bridge
  hardcoded `opie-` regardless of the env var. (The fix already existed
  in the openclaw-mcp bridge from v2.4 — it's now propagated through the
  ported tools too.)
- **`session_end` git commit message respects `AGENT_ID`.** Was hardcoded
  `"brain: Opie session end"`; now uses the running agent's id.
- **Single shared HTTP client.** All tools route through the `mnemoRequest`
  helper with 10s timeout + abort-on-stall. Replaces the legacy bridge's
  fire-and-hope `fetch` calls.
- **`BRAIN_DIR`, `WIKI_DIR`, `DREAM_DIR` env vars** for non-default install
  paths. Defaults still match the Sparks-Brain reference layout — but
  non-Sparks users can override.
- **Archived `mnemo-cortex-mcp` repo stays archived.** No further changes
  there. The legacy `server.js` was patched in-place earlier the same day
  for the agent-ID prefix bug — fix kept locally for any installs still
  pointing at that path; this release supersedes it.

### Migration

If you're still pointing at the legacy bridge (`mnemo-cortex-mcp/server.js`)
or the slim openclaw-mcp bridge (`mnemo-cortex/integrations/openclaw-mcp/server.js`
pre-v2.5.0):

1. Pull latest `mnemo-cortex`.
2. `cd integrations/openclaw-mcp && npm install`.
3. Update your MCP config command path to point at this `server.js`.
4. Restart whatever spawns the bridge (Claude Code session, OpenClaw gateway).

Tool names and behavior are unchanged — existing prompts and agent muscle
memory keep working.

---

## v2.4.1 — "Developer's Passport" (2026-04-22)

Passport gets an honest name and the tuning loop lands its first real pass.
This is a dev-targeted release: the product is aimed at developers building
agent systems who want a known-good pattern for safe behavioral-claim
ingestion. The possessive in the name is deliberate — it drops when the
hosted / browser-AI story is ready for normal users. Not today.

### What Changed

- **Rebrand: Passport → Developer's Passport** (product name only; code
  paths, tool names, YAML schema, and REST API all unchanged). `passport/`
  stays `passport/`. `passport_get_user_context` still `passport_get_user_context`.
- **Policy tweaks applied after corpus run.** Three policy changes approved
  and committed against the shipped 200-entry eval corpus:
  - `bucket_defaults.semi_trusted_remote`: `review_required` → `allow`
  - `bucket_defaults.untrusted_web`: `local_only` → `review_required`
  - `dispositions.insufficient_evidence`: new key, `review_required`
  `validation.py` now routes the <2-evidence short-circuit through the
  policy map instead of hard-coding `hard_block`, matching the pattern used
  for every other disposition.
- **Eval numbers published.** Overall moved from 48.0% / 0.428 macro-F1
  (baseline) to 53.0% / 0.458 (+5pp / +0.030) after the tweaks. Per-class
  F1: `allow` +0.251, `review_required` +0.089, `hard_block` +0.027,
  `local_only` -0.246. The `local_only` regression is inherent to raising
  the `untrusted_web` floor — those cases now land at `review_required`
  where a human can make the call. Detail in `passport/README.md`.
- **README rewritten for developers.** UNDER CONSTRUCTION banner removed.
  Accurate 5-tool table. 5-minute dev quickstart. Honest Known Gaps section
  (no Phase 2 classifier, no hosted HTTP MCP wrapper, no review UI, weak
  `local_only` F1, no per-user repo sync automation).
- **Chrome extension and claude.ai HTTP connector work parked** — neither
  was shipping in this release and neither was honest to advertise. When
  there's a live user for the browser path, that work resumes. Until then,
  the dev integration via stdio MCP (`integrations/openclaw-mcp/`) is the
  shipped path.
- **Eval corpus held separately.** The 200-entry labeled corpus used to
  produce the numbers above contains detector-bait tokens (fake-but-
  well-formed API keys) that trip public secret scanners. The harness
  (`tests/passport/corpus_score.py`) is in the repo; the corpus itself
  ships on request — open an issue for access.

### Why This Matters

The previous framing — "portable AI identity that travels with you to any
AI" — was writing a check the shipped code couldn't cash. The stdio MCP
integration works. The HTTP-to-claude.ai path doesn't exist yet. Renaming
to *Developer's* Passport aligns the pitch with what the product actually
delivers: a reference-grade safety + review-queue layer for devs who want
to wire it into their own agent stacks today.

### Models / Cost

No model changes. Validator is deterministic rule + detector logic; no LLM
calls in the hot path. Eval harness calls no LLM — it scores the current
validator against the labeled corpus.

## v2.4.0 — "Compile, Connect, Adapt" (2026-04-22)

The biggest release since v2.0. Three new feature surfaces land alongside the existing memory + dreaming core. Mnemo is now a full memory architecture, not just a memory store.

### What Changed

- **WikAI compiler** — `mnemo-wiki-compile.py` lands in the repo. Nightly cron at 3:30 AM (15 min after Dreaming) reads recent Mnemo memories, clusters by topic in Python (no LLM routing), then per-topic calls gemini-2.5-flash to rewrite the corresponding wiki page integrating new information. Cross-references are validated against the live page set — no hallucinated wikilinks. Every page carries a provenance footer listing source memory session IDs. Per-page failure isolation; one bad LLM call posts ⚠️ to `#alerts` and the run continues. Cost: ~$0.01–$0.05 per nightly. The wiki is never edited directly; Mnemo is the source of truth.
- **Sparks Bus** — agent-to-agent messaging with delivery confirmation, shipped as `sparks_bus/` inside this repo and standalone at github.com/GuyMannDude/sparks-bus. Doctrine: Discord = doorbell, Mnemo = mailbox, tracking ID = receipt. Lifecycle in `#dispatch`: 📬 DELIVERED → ✅ PICKED UP → 🔄 LOOP CLOSED. One-shot ⚠️ alerts on failure (no retry storms). Two install modes auto-detected: Full (with Mnemo) or Standalone (payload in Discord notification). A2A-compatible: Agent Cards in `sparks_bus/agent-cards/`, task-shape translator in the watcher, `A2A.md` mapping reference, `SETUP-PROMPT.md` for AI-bootstrapped deployments.
- **Passport** — portable user working-style preferences. Five MCP tools (`passport_observe_behavior`, `passport_list_pending_observations`, `passport_promote_observation`, `passport_forget_or_override`, `passport_get_user_context`). Observations become candidates, only stable claims promote — nothing auto-lands in the user's profile.
- **Three-layer architecture documented** — Mnemo (source of truth, query-time) + WikAI (compiled view, write-time) + Brain files (live state, ephemeral). When they disagree, Mnemo wins.
- **Inspirations credited openly** — Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern (WikAI), Nate B Jones's hybrid analysis (three-layer architecture), Google A2A (Sparks Bus compatibility), Mem0 (bridge not replace).
- **README + CAPABILITIES + landing page updated** — feature overview block, new sections, updated full-stack ASCII diagram.

### Why This Matters

Before v2.4, agents could remember (Mnemo), agents could share (Dreaming), and agents could fall back to depth (Mem0). After v2.4, agents can also:
- Read a *compiled* understanding of the project state without re-deriving from raw data on every query (WikAI)
- Send each other tracked, ack'd messages with the lifecycle visible to the operator in one Discord channel (Sparks Bus)
- Adapt their tone and workflow to how *this user* works (Passport)

The v2.4 release is when Mnemo became a memory architecture, not a memory server.

### Models / Cost

No model changes. WikAI compiler + Dreaming both run on `google/gemini-2.5-flash` via OpenRouter. Combined nightly cost: under $0.10.

---

## v2.3.2 — "Fresh Models" (2026-04-11)

Doc audit triggered by external user report: setup guide referenced dead Google model name (`text-embedding-004`, shut down Jan 2026), causing hours of debugging silent failures.

### What Changed

- **Model tier table updated** — Added Google cloud tier (`gemini-embedding-001` + `gemini-2.5-flash`), updated OpenAI reasoning model to `gpt-4.1-nano` (10x cheaper than `gpt-4o-mini`). All model names verified against current provider APIs.
- **Google deprecation warning** — Explicit callout that `text-embedding-004` is dead, use `gemini-embedding-001`.
- **Troubleshooting section added to README** — Covers the three most common failure modes: "No chunks" (wrong embedding model name), compaction model unreachable, server unreachable. Includes current model name table by provider.
- **Expected test output added to README** — Users can now see what a passing smoke test looks like before they run it.
- **Version bumped** — pyproject.toml synced to 2.3.2.

### Problem This Solves

Model names change without notice. A user following our docs could configure a dead model, get zero results from recall, and have no idea why. The troubleshooting section now explicitly warns about this and lists current model names by provider.

### Models Verified (April 2026)

| Provider | Embedding | Reasoning | Status |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Ollama | nomic-embed-text | qwen2.5:32b-instruct | Current |
| OpenAI | text-embedding-3-small | gpt-4.1-nano | Current |
| Google | gemini-embedding-001 | gemini-2.5-flash | Current (flash sunsets June 2026) |

## v2.3.1 — "Total Recall" (2026-04-08)

Documented auto-capture and added the `MNEMO_AUTO_CAPTURE` environment variable gate.

### What's New

- **Auto-Capture documentation** — New README section covering the two capture patterns (OpenClaw/Claude Code session watcher, Claude Desktop MCP bridge), quick start, and always-on configuration.
- **`MNEMO_AUTO_CAPTURE` env var** — Set to `true` and `mnemo-cortex start` automatically starts the session watcher. Default: off. No behavior change for existing users.

### Problem This Solves

Auto-capture has been working in production for weeks (CC watcher running 2+ weeks straight, zero failures) but wasn't documented anywhere in the public repo. New users had no idea the feature existed.

---

## v2.3.0 — "The Responsible Thing" (2026-04-07)

Pulled the Claude Desktop MCP bridge until Anthropic's new session storage architecture is supported.

### What Changed

- **Claude Desktop integration removed** — `integrations/claude-desktop/` pulled from the repo. The MCP tools (recall, search, save, startup, brain file read/write) worked correctly, but the automatic session watcher depended on Claude Desktop writing `.jsonl` files to `~/.config/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/`. Desktop v2.1.87+ ("cowork VM" architecture) moved session storage to internal IndexedDB/LevelDB. The watcher had nothing to watch.
- **README, CAPABILITIES, health output updated** — All references to the Desktop integration now include a notice explaining the pull and that Claude Code + OpenClaw integrations are unaffected.
- **mnemo-cortex-mcp repo unchanged** — The archived standalone repo already redirects here. Its README still points to this repo as the canonical source.

### Problem This Solves

Anyone following the Desktop setup docs would get a dead session watcher that silently captured nothing. Opie (our own Desktop agent) ran for 13 days with a broken watcher before we caught it. Rather than ship a known-broken integration, we pulled it.

### What's Next

The MCP server itself is fine — the 7 tools work. The gap is automatic session capture. Options being evaluated:
1. Read from Claude Desktop's new LevelDB/IndexedDB storage
2. MCP-only memory persistence (no file watcher needed)
3. Wait for Anthropic to expose a session export API

### Claude Code and OpenClaw users

Nothing changed for you. Your integrations work exactly as before.

---

## v2.2.0 — "One Repo, One Install" (2026-04-04)

Merged the MCP bridge (formerly mnemo-cortex-mcp) into the main repo. One product, one install.

### What's New

- **Built-in MCP bridge** — The Claude Desktop / Claude Code MCP server now lives at `integrations/claude-desktop/`. No separate repo needed. 7 tools: recall, search, save, startup, read/write/list brain files.
- **mnemo-cortex-mcp archived** — The old separate repo redirects here. All existing links still work.

### Problem This Solves

Users had to find and install two separate repos to get memory working. That's broken. Now it's one clone, one install.

### Migration

If you were using `mnemo-cortex-mcp` separately:
1. Pull the latest `mnemo-cortex`
2. Update your MCP config path: `mnemo-cortex-mcp/server.js` → `mnemo-cortex/integrations/claude-desktop/server.js`
3. Run `cd integrations/claude-desktop && npm install`

---


## v2.1.0 — "No Agent Runs Without Verified Memory" (2026-04-04)

Built-in deployment health verification. Auto-discovers agents, tests live recall, validates MCP configs, checks watchers.

### What's New

- **`mnemo-cortex health` command** — Comprehensive deployment health check that auto-discovers every agent from the database and runs live recall tests against each one. No hardcoded agent names.
- **MCP config validation** — `--check-mcp` flag verifies mnemo-cortex is registered as an MCP server in any config file (OpenClaw, Claude Desktop, etc). Catches the exact bug where an agent's MCP pipe is silently broken.
- **Watcher service monitoring** — Auto-discovers all mnemo-related systemd services and reports their status.
- **Multiple output modes** — `--json` for scripts/monitoring, `--quiet` for cron (exit code only), `--agents` for agent-only checks, `--services` for watcher-only checks.
- **CronAlarm integration** — Drop-in compatible with cron alerting. Non-zero exit on any failure.

### Problem This Solves

Rocky's Mnemo MCP tools were missing from his openclaw.json config. Nobody knew until Guy tried to use them — weeks later. This command catches that in 10 seconds, automatically, on a schedule.

### Usage

```
mnemo-cortex health                         # full check, human output
mnemo-cortex health --json                  # machine-readable for scripts
mnemo-cortex health --quiet                 # exit code only (for cron)
mnemo-cortex health --agents                # only test agent recall
mnemo-cortex health --services              # only check watcher services
mnemo-cortex health --check-mcp ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
mnemo-cortex health http://artforge:50001   # explicit server URL
```

### CronAlarm Example

```
0 */6 * * * mnemo-cortex health --quiet || cronalarm send "Mnemo health failed"
```

## v2.0.0 — "Don't Fear the /new!" (2026-03-17)

Ground-up rewrite. SQLite replaces JSONL. Proven on two live agents with six weeks of unbroken recall.

### What's New

- **SQLite + FTS5 storage** — All memory in a single database with full-text search. No more JSONL files. Fast, portable, zero dependencies.
- **Context frontier with active compaction** — Rolling window of messages + summaries. Older messages are automatically summarized, achieving ~80% token compression while preserving perfect recall.
- **DAG-based summary lineage with source expansion** — Every summary tracks which messages it was built from via a directed acyclic graph. The `summary_sources` table links condensed summaries back to their leaf summaries, creating full traceability from any summary to its original messages.
- **Verbatim replay mode** — Summaries are the default view, but any summary can be expanded back to the original messages for full-fidelity context.
- **OpenClaw session watcher daemon** — Lightweight sidecar that tails JSONL session files and ingests new messages into SQLite every 2 seconds. No hooks, no agent cooperation required.
- **Context refresher daemon** — Writes `MNEMO-CONTEXT.md` to the agent's workspace on a 5-second interval. The agent reads it at bootstrap for instant memory hydration.
- **Provider-backed summarization via OpenRouter** — Compaction summaries generated by Gemini 2.5 Flash via OpenRouter, with deterministic truncation fallback when no API key is available. No local GPU required.
- **Sidecar architecture** — Version-resistant design that observes session files from outside the agent. Mnemo keeps your memory on disk — if either process restarts, the data is already there.

### Live Deployment

Proven on two live OpenClaw agents:

- **Alice** (THE VAULT, Threadripper 3970X) — Running since early March 2026
- **Rocky** (IGOR, Ubuntu laptop) — Deployed March 17, 2026. 3,000+ messages ingested, 429+ summaries generated, 20+ conversations tracked. Recall to Day One.

### Breaking Changes

- v2.0 uses a completely new storage backend (SQLite) and does not share data with v1's JSONL/semantic cache system
- The v1 HTTP API (`/context`, `/preflight`, `/writeback`, `/ingest`) is still available via the FastAPI server but is no longer the primary integration path
- The recommended integration is now file-based: watcher daemon → SQLite → refresher daemon → `MNEMO-CONTEXT.md` → agent bootstrap
