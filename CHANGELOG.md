# Changelog

## v4.9.12 (2026-07-07) — Server hardening: streamed body cap, immortal maintenance loop, preflight fail-closed (clean-room review M-group, part 1)

**Problem.** Four server-side M-group findings, all variations of "the guard exists but is
half-wired." (M1) The body-size cap only read the Content-Length header — a chunked request
(no header) skipped the check entirely, so an arbitrarily large body still reached the JSON
parser, the embedder, and disk. (M2) `maintenance_loop` iterated the live tenant dict while
awaiting inside the loop; a tenant created by a request mid-cycle raised "dict changed size
during iteration" OUTSIDE any try, killing archival + dreamer + Analyst + Muse silently until
the next restart (and the bare `create_task` result wasn't even kept — the task could be GC'd).
(M4) `/preflight` returned `verdict=PASS` whenever validation itself blew up (reasoner outage,
garbage JSON) — a gate that rubber-stamps exactly when it can't see. (M5) `/preflight` was also
the one tenant payload that skipped both `redact_text` (prompt + draft went verbatim to the
possibly-remote reasoner) and `_enforce_scope` (no scoped-token tenant pin). Plus the passport
`/observe` evidence list had `min_length=2` but no max — unbounded O(rows × detectors) regex
work on a network endpoint.

**Fix.** (M1) `BodySizeLimitMiddleware` — pure ASGI, counts bytes as the body streams and
raises a 413 `HTTPException` at the first chunk crossing the cap (header fast-path kept).
(M2) cycles iterate a snapshot (`list(...)`), each cycle runs inside try/except so one bad
cycle can't end maintenance, the task reference is kept with a done-callback that logs loudly
if the loop ever dies, and it's cancelled cleanly on shutdown. The cycle body is exposed as
`app.state.maintenance_cycle` so tests can run one deterministically. (M4) validation failure
now returns `verdict=UNAVAILABLE, confidence=0.0` — the caller decides; a reply missing the
verdict key counts as malformed, not PASS. (M5) preflight runs prompt + draft through the same
redaction choke point as `/writeback`/`/ingest`, enforces the scoped-token pin, and
`/preflight` joins `SCOPABLE_ENDPOINTS`. Passport evidence capped at 64 rows, `turn_ref` at
400 chars. Tests 522 → 534.

## v4.9.11 (2026-07-06) — Passport Lane test coverage + version single-source (clean-room review H10/H11)

**Problem.** (H10) The Passport Lane — 14 modules, ~2,300 lines whose entire job is stopping
PII/secret/injection leakage across agents — had one test file, covering only the validation layer.
The 5 `/passport/*` HTTP routes, all four detector families, and the git auto-commit helper had no
direct coverage at all. (H11) The release version was hardcoded in 5 places; drift shipped three
separate times (v4.9.1, v4.9.2, v4.9.4). The review suggested `importlib.metadata` as the single
source, but that would have been WRONG for our deploy model: the live box runs from a git checkout,
and a stale installed dist (2.3.2, months old) shadows every `git pull` — the server would have
reported a version from last winter.

**Fix.** (H10) Three new test files: `tests/passport/test_api.py` (all 5 routes, happy + failure
paths through a real TestClient, including hard-blocked secrets never entering the pending queue),
`test_detectors.py` (per-detector true/false-positive tests for secrets/PII/private-dict/injection,
redaction round-trip, `detectors.yaml` narrowing + severity overrides, previews never leak the raw
match), and `test_git_helper.py` (tmp_path repo: init idempotence, commit SHA contract, no-change
→ None, message truncation, no remote ever configured). (H11) `agentb.__version__` resolves
checkout-first — `pyproject.toml` next to the package wins, dist metadata only for real wheel
installs — and `server.py` (app + `/health`) and `cli.py` now serve it. The drift-guard test flips
polarity: it now FAILS if a hardcoded `version="X.Y.Z"` literal ever reappears in served code. The
bump ritual shrinks to pyproject.toml + robot.info + CHANGELOG.

## v4.9.10 (2026-07-06) — `migrate reindex --all` no longer dies on archived tenant snapshots

**Problem.** The `--all` discovery globs every `<data_dir>/agents/*` dir with a `memory/` subdir —
including archived tenant snapshots like `rocky.archived-20260516`. Those names contain a dot,
which `validate_agent_id` (the v4.9.5 C1 guard) rejects, so the whole reindex run crashed on a
ValueError before touching a single live tenant. Found running the post-H5 cleanup reindex on the
live store.

**Fix.** Discovery filters candidates through `validate_agent_id` and prints a loud
`Skipping non-tenant dir:` line for each rejected name — archived snapshots are cold copies, not
served tenants, and were never meant to be reindexed. Explicit `--agent` behavior unchanged.

## v4.9.9 (2026-07-06) — EMBEDDING INTEGRITY: empty-vector brick + foreign-space store fallback (clean-room review H4/H5)

**Problem.** (H4) Ollama and Google embedding providers turned a malformed-but-200 response into an
empty `[]` vector. `ResilientEmbedding._check_dim` then locked `_locked_dim = 0` from that first
"successful" primary embed, and every subsequent valid 768-dim vector was rejected (`768 != 0`)
until process restart — one transient malformed response disabled all saves and vector recalls.
(The 4.5 foundation audit had already added refuse-and-alert, but the empty vector could still
poison the lock.) (H5) The only guard on a fallback vector was its *dimension*. The live config —
Gemini fallback with `output_dimensionality: 768` for nomic compat — passes that check, but a
different model embeds in a different vector *space*: cosine between spaces is meaningless, so
every breaker-open window wrote store-path fallback vectors into the index as silent unrecallable
noise. `migrate.py` itself calls foreign-space rows "the exact corruption this reindex exists to
remove," yet `/writeback` allowed it on every primary hiccup.

**Fix.** (H4) All five embedding providers now raise on an empty/missing embedding
(`_require_vector`), so the failure enters the normal retry/fallback path; `_check_dim`
additionally rejects `n == 0` outright and can never lock 0. Recovery needs no restart. (H5) The
store path (`task_type="document"` — every vector that gets written: /writeback, /trajectory/save,
analyst, the dreamer cycle, L3-scan candidate embeds) refuses fallbacks running a *different
model* than the primary via the existing refuse-and-alert machinery; a same-model fallback (a
mirror host — `:latest` tag normalized) still serves, and the query path still falls back freely —
degraded recall during an outage writes nothing durable. Outage semantics: capture (`/ingest`)
never embeds so nothing is lost; `/writeback` keeps the memory JSON on disk unindexed; after an
extended primary outage run `mnemo-cortex reindex` (or wait for L3 scans) to vec-index the
memories saved during the window. The five 4.5-era tests that pinned foreign-model fallback on the
default path now pin it on the query path. 12 new regression tests
(`test_embedding_integrity.py`).

## v4.9.8 (2026-07-06) — DATA INTEGRITY: cc-sync per-session offsets + torn-line holdback (clean-room review, H2/H3 sibling)

**Problem.** `integrations/claude-code/mnemo-cc-sync.py` tracked a single `{session_id, byte_offset}`
and synced only the newest JSONL per tick. Two live Claude Code sessions alternate as "newest", so
every flip reset the offset to 0 — re-posting the whole file (duplicate floods) — and the
non-newest session's tail below the batch threshold stranded unsynced. It also had the watcher's H2
torn-line bug: text-mode iteration + `f.tell()` meant a tick landing mid-append hit
`JSONDecodeError` on the partial line, skipped it, and left the offset past it forever.

**Fix.** Every session file modified within the active window (`MNEMO_CC_ACTIVE_HOURS`, default 24)
now syncs against its own offset in a per-file map; a failed POST leaves that file's offset alone
and retries next tick. `parse_new_messages` consumes only newline-terminated bytes, so torn lines
wait for their newline (and splits on `\n` only — `splitlines()` would fragment records containing
raw U+2028/U+2029, which Claude Code emits inside JSON strings). Upgrade-safe: the legacy
single-session offset is carried over, and a one-time seed starts other pre-existing files at EOF
(sync forward only) — starting them at 0 would re-flood everything the old regime already posted.
(Fresh-install note: a session already in progress at install time syncs forward from install, not
from its beginning.) One vanished file can't abort the tick for other sessions; state persists
after every successful post so a mid-tick crash can't re-post; the top-level `last_post_at` mirror
is kept for the sync-watchdog; state prunes entries for deleted files. 10 new regression tests
(`test_cc_sync_offsets.py`).

## v4.9.7 (2026-07-06) — DATA INTEGRITY: the four silent data-loss paths (clean-room review H2/H3/H1/H7)

**Problem.** The clean-room review found four independent ways the capture/delivery pipeline
silently lost data — in the components whose entire job is crash-safety. (H2) The session watcher
read from a byte offset with `readlines()` + `f.tell()`, so a poll landing mid-append consumed a
torn final JSONL line and permanently skipped both halves of that exchange. (H3) The watcher
advanced its offset even when `/ingest` failed — a 10-minute Mnemo restart permanently lost every
exchange in the window. (Adjacent, same function: a poll landing between the user line and the
assistant line dropped the whole exchange, because the lone user message couldn't pair yet but the
offset moved past it — same bug class, found while fixing H2/H3.) (H1) The Claude Code offline
writeback queue had broken argv indexing (`sys.argv[5]` is the queue dir only with exactly one key
fact), swallowed all errors with `2>/dev/null || true`, and printed a false "Saved". (H7) The bus
watcher stamped `delivery_failed_at` even when the Discord alert itself failed to post — and every
scanner filters on that stamp, so a message that failed during a Discord outage vanished forever.

**Fix.** The watcher's offset is now a commit record: it reads bytes and only consumes up to the
last newline (torn lines wait for their newline), holds back a trailing unpaired user message until
its assistant reply lands, and on the first failed `/ingest` parks at that exchange's user line so
the chunk retries next poll. Server-side, `SessionManager.ingest` dedups by content hash within a
15-minute window (bounded LRU, seeded from the newest hot file on startup) so chunk retries and
crash-recovery re-sends are idempotent — `/ingest` returns `status="duplicate"` with a 200 so
clients advance. Also hardened in the same file: truncated/rotated session files reset their offset
instead of wedging, and the positions file is written atomically (tmp + `os.replace`) so a crash
mid-save can't wipe every offset. H1: queue dir is now the first argv (`qdir, sid, aid, summary,
*facts = sys.argv[1:]`), and a queue-write failure reports and exits 1 instead of lying. H7: the
failure stamp only lands when the alert actually posted; otherwise the row stays visible and both
delivery and alert retry next cycle. 13 new regression tests (`test_watcher_data_loss.py`,
`test_ingest_dedup.py`).

## v4.9.6 (2026-07-06) — SECURITY: close session_id path traversal (clean-room review, C1 sibling)

**Problem.** The v4.9.5 review flagged a second traversal in the same class as C1 but a different
function family: `SessionManager.get_session_transcript` (behind `GET /sessions/{session_id}/transcript`)
interpolated a request-supplied `session_id` straight into `hot_dir / f"{session_id}.jsonl"` (and the
warm/cold `.gz` variants). `../../secret` or an absolute id escaped the session dir, turning the
endpoint into an arbitrary-`*.jsonl`/`*.jsonl.gz` file-read primitive. (The v4.9.5 C1 fix only covered
the `agent_id`/`get_agent_data_dir` family, so this stayed open.)

**Fix.** New `validate_session_id()` in `config.py` (`[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,128}` — generated ids look like
`2026-07-06_121245_a1b2c3`), enforced deep in `get_session_transcript` (raises `ValueError`) and
mapped to HTTP 400 at the transcript endpoint. `_start_session` uses server-generated ids and
`/writeback`'s `session_id` only feeds a hash (never a path), so no other sink needed guarding. 14 new
regression tests (incl. a real ingest→retrieve round-trip proving valid ids still work); suite 424 green.

## v4.9.5 (2026-07-06) — SECURITY: tenant path traversal closed + fail-closed auth (clean-room review C1/C2)

**Problem.** The clean-room Fable review of v4.9.4 confirmed two criticals. (C1) `get_agent_data_dir`
joined a request-supplied `agent_id` straight into the tenant path — and `pathlib` discards the
left operand when the right is absolute, so `agent_id="/etc/cron.d/x"` resolved to `/etc/cron.d/x`
and `"../../../tmp/pwn"` escaped the data root; `/writeback` would then create dirs and write
attacker-controlled JSON anywhere the process can write. (C2) The auth middleware only mounts
`if auth_token or scoped_tokens` — both default empty — while `host` defaults to `0.0.0.0`, so a
stock deployment binds all interfaces with **no auth on any endpoint**. (The live IGOR-2 box was
unaffected — it has a token set, verified `POST /writeback` -> 401 — but a fresh beta or PyPI
install would be wide open.)

**Fix.** (C1) New `validate_agent_id()` in `config.py` — `agent_id` must match `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}`.
Enforced in `get_agent_data_dir` (deep guard, raises `ValueError`) and at the `TenantManager.get`
boundary (maps to HTTP 400), so every tenant endpoint rejects traversal/absolute IDs before any
path is built. (C2) Fail-closed: `assert_safe_auth_posture()` runs in the FastAPI **lifespan startup
handler** — so it fires on every serving path (`uvicorn agentb.server:app` / the systemd unit /
gunicorn, and `python -m agentb.server`), not just `__main__` — and refuses to start when a
non-loopback host has no auth and no explicit `server.allow_unauthenticated: true` opt-in.
`create_app` also logs a loud SECURITY warning at import, and `__main__` asserts before bind for a
clean CLI error. New `server.allow_unauthenticated` config field (documented in `agentb.yaml.example`)
for deliberate open deploys behind an external gatekeeper. 30 new regression tests in
`test_security_c1_c2.py` (incl. one that asserts app startup itself refuses an open posture); suite
410 green.

Also (C4): added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — the project had 6k+ lines of pytest and a wheel smoke
test that nothing ran automatically, which is why version drift shipped in v4.9.1/v4.9.2 and nearly
v4.9.4. CI now runs the full suite on Python 3.11 + 3.12 (activating the drift-guard and the new
security regressions) plus `scripts/wheel-smoke-test.sh` on every push/PR.

Also (C3): the Docker image could never boot — the Dockerfile COPY'd only `agentb/` while
`create_app` imports `passport.api` at module load (and `sparks_bus` ships as package data), so
`python -m agentb.server` died on ModuleNotFoundError in every image ever built; no CI existed to
catch it. Fixed: the image now `pip install .`s from `pyproject.toml` with all three packages
copied in, and runs as a non-root user. Verified end-to-end: image builds, `import agentb.server`
resolves, an unconfigured container fail-closes with the C2 remediation message (not a crash), and
a container with a mounted config serves `/health` and 401s unauthenticated writes. A `docker-boot`
CI job now guards the drift class.

## v4.9.4 (2026-07-06) — Stage 0.7 judge learns aesthetic techniques (Opie #1087 rule-5 ruling)

**Problem.** A proven aesthetic technique reused across art sessions (melody-contour steering,
the both-versions IP rule) never survived the Stage 0.7 judge: nothing *failed*, so the
failure-first prompt filed it under "it worked when done carefully" and emitted nothing. The
proposed fix — carving the Muse's rule 5 to catch reused techniques — was rejected (#1087): the
Muse hunts *abandoned* threads; a reused technique is the opposite, and muddying rule 5 would let
any completed task reframe itself as "a technique I applied."

**Fix.** Prompt-only, per the ruling — the conservatism knob stays the prompt, nothing else.
The judge gets one bounded exception to the clean-success bar: an AESTHETIC TECHNIQUE is
distillable when the stream evidences aesthetic *choice* (an approach picked over an alternative
for how the result looks, iterated against visual judgment, or explicitly kept/praised by the
user). Executing an art pipeline cleanly still earns nothing. Technique items MUST use the
cross-cutting `task_type: art-technique` — never the pipeline task (`gallery-drop`, ...) — so a
single `mnemo_recall_trajectory(task_type="art-technique")` at art-session start returns the
technique briefing regardless of which art task triggered it. Drift-guard tests pin the
exception wording, the cross-cutting routing rule, and the zero-is-normal conservatism line.

Also: the version-in-N-places trap is now a test, not a ritual. Review caught `server.py`'s two
hardcoded strings (FastAPI app + `/health`) still at 4.9.3 — the same miss that needed follow-up
commits in v4.9.1 AND v4.9.2. New `test_served_versions_match_release` fails the suite whenever
any `version="X.Y.Z"` literal in `server.py`/`cli.py` drifts from `pyproject.toml`.

## v4.9.3 (2026-07-05) — GET /dream/latest + analyst notes stop landing NULL in the vec category column

**Problem.** Two finds from the same live audit. (1) The dream brief never reached agents on
machines other than the Cortex host: the bridge read `DREAM_DIR` from *its own* local disk inside
a silent catch, but the dreamer writes dreams on the *server's* disk — so every `agent_startup`
off-host silently skipped the DREAM BRIEF section (misread in the field as a `/context` timeout).
(2) The NULL-category vec rows the #468 backfill was supposed to drain were *growing* (202 → 212):
`analyst.py` saves analyst/muse notes with a category in the JSON but omitted `category=` in the
`vec_store.upsert(...)` call, so every new note landed NULL in the search pre-filter column — and
the hourly reclassifier never drains them because the JSON side looks correctly categorized.

**Fix.** (1) New `GET /dream/latest`: serves the newest `<data_dir>/dreams/*.md` with `date` and
`age_hours`; the bridge (2.14.0) asks the server first and keeps the local read as an offline
fallback. (2) One-line pushdown fix in `analyst.py` — notes now carry their category into
`vec_sources`; existing NULL rows drained with the standing `migrate vec-backfill` deploy step.
Also caught `cli.py --version` still at 4.9.1 (missed in the 4.9.2 bump — the version-in-four-places
trap): all four version strings verified at 4.9.3.

## v4.9.2 (2026-07-05) — /context: stop the routine 23s L3 disk-walk

**Problem.** On a session_log-dominated store (cc: 6.2k memories, 65% session_log), most default
recalls paid a 20–25s L3 disk-walk: a session-flavored prompt's nearest neighbors are nearly all
session_log, so even the 15× filtered kNN over-fetch (#468) filtered down to fewer than
max_results — and the L3 gate only honored the *pinned-category* case, so the default session_log
*exclusion* fell through to L3, which re-embeds up to 80 candidate documents per query
(~250ms each). Observed live: 23s /context calls; the morning agent_startup dream-brief timeout
was this at scale.

**Fix.** Two-part, in the /context handler: (1) on a filtered underfill, re-run the kNN once with
a 5× wider over-fetch — milliseconds — before accepting a partial set; (2) the L3 gate now honors
the vec.search pushdown contract for ANY category filter, exclusion included: if the filtered kNN
(plus escalation) served even one survivor, return the partial pool instead of walking the disk.
Zero VEC survivors still falls through to L3, which keeps the un-backfilled-index escape hatch
(NULL category columns) intact. Live effect on the cc store: 23s → sub-second.

## v4.9.1 (2026-07-04) — Muse judge round 3: dedup + doctrine-echo rules

**Problem.** Muse audition round 2 (precision 2/4) failed in exactly two ways: the same underlying
idea emitted twice in one batch (reworded, not new), and an existing project doctrine echoed back
dressed as "a valuable heuristic" — an application of a known principle presented as creation.
Both slipped the v4.8.0 prompt: no in-batch dedup rule existed, and the observations-aren't-ideas
rule didn't name the echo disguise.

**Fix.** Prompt-only (`MUSE_SYSTEM_PROMPT`): rule 3 extended to kill doctrine ECHOES regardless of
dressing; new rule 10 — one note per underlying idea, strongest survives, a rewording is not a
second idea. No code paths touched.

## v4.9.0 (2026-07-03) — Scoped tokens: per-tenant, per-endpoint auth

**Problem.** The server had exactly one credential: `server.auth_token`, an all-or-nothing master
key to all 23 endpoints and every agent tenant. Any less-trusted caller — a gateway, a shared
automation, a script on another machine — had to hold the master key, so a single leak meant the
whole fleet's memory. (Designing a public remote-MCP gateway made this concrete: the gateway would
have held god-mode over every tenant. That build was stood down, but the missing auth tier is real
regardless.)

**Fix.** New optional `server.scoped_tokens` list — each entry pins a bearer token to one
`agent_id` and an endpoint allowlist:

```yaml
server:
  auth_token: "${MNEMO_AUTH_TOKEN}"      # master — full access, unchanged
  scoped_tokens:
    - token: "${MNEMO_TOKEN_HELPER}"
      agent_id: helper
      endpoints: ["/context", "/writeback"]
```

A scoped request must hit an allowlisted endpoint (else 403) **and** carry the pinned `agent_id`
in its body (else 403 — a missing `agent_id` also fails, since it would land in the `default`
tenant). Only endpoints that enforce the pin can be allowlisted (`/context`, `/writeback`,
`/trajectory/save`, `/trajectory/recall`); the config loader rejects anything else at startup, so
an unpinned endpoint can never be granted by accident. Empty/unresolved tokens are rejected at
load (an empty token would match requests with no auth header). All token comparisons — including
the pre-existing master check — now use constant-time `hmac.compare_digest`. No config change =
byte-identical behavior: the master token works exactly as before, and servers with no auth
configured stay open.

## v4.8.1 (2026-07-02) — macOS support pass: passport portability fix, green suite on fresh installs, launchd + install guide

**Problem.** Three things stood between a fresh `git clone` on a Mac and a working, verifiable
install. (1) A real passport bug: the untrusted-alone rule in `passport/validation.py` only fired
when the final disposition was `allow`, so when the trust-bucket floor had already raised the
disposition to `review_required`, portability stayed `portable` — an observation backed *only* by
untrusted web evidence could still be marked portable to the shared passport, contradicting the
rule's own comment ("the data cannot be trusted enough to promote to the shared passport"). The
pre-existing red test `test_all_untrusted_web_caps_at_local_only` (#425) was correct all along.
(2) Fresh installs get today's dep versions: `pytest-asyncio` 1.x removes the implicit event loop,
turning `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(...)` in `tests/test_agentb.py` into 10
order-dependent failures; Starlette 1.x adds router objects without `.path` to `app.routes`,
breaking the health-route smoke test. A beta tester running the suite saw 12 failures on any OS.
(3) macOS had no install path: no guide, no launchd unit, and the #1 darwin gotcha (Apple's and
python.org's Python builds ship SQLite without loadable-extension support, so
`enable_load_extension` at `vec.py` doesn't exist) was undocumented.

**Fix.** (1) The untrusted-alone rule now also caps *portability* at `local_only` whenever every
evidence row is `untrusted_web` (disposition still escalates `allow → local_only` as before);
suite is 352/352. (2) Tests modernized: `asyncio.run(...)` everywhere (verified green on
pytest-asyncio 0.26 *and* 1.4), route smoke test skips path-less router objects. (3) New
[`docs/install-macos.md`](docs/install-macos.md) — Homebrew-Python-only warning with a 10-second
preflight check, Ollama setup, bridge setup, troubleshooting — plus
[`deploy/macos/com.mnemo-cortex.server.plist`](deploy/macos/) launchd template with
install/uninstall steps. Verified without Mac hardware: the full dependency tree resolves as
prebuilt wheels for `macosx_11_0_arm64` and Intel on Python 3.12/3.13/3.14 (`pip download
--only-binary=:all:`) — nothing compiles at install time. Homebrew formula deferred: `sqlite-vec`
ships no sdist and mnemo-cortex isn't on PyPI yet; publishing to PyPI unlocks `pipx install`
as the one-liner instead.

## v4.8.0 (2026-07-02) — The Creative Harness: `idea` category, the Muse, riff-scale capture, recall mode=explore

**Problem.** The creative-harness audit (bus #1002→#1003) found every distillation layer was
task-shaped by design: the Stage 0.7 judge only admits task recipes, the Stage 0.5 fact extractor
explicitly skips speculative language ("might/considering/exploring" — the native grammar of
ideation), the category enum had no home for creative content (so idea seeds fell into
`session_log`: hidden from recall by default, importance floor 0.20), the CC sync bridge
truncated every conversation turn to 300 chars while surfacing only tool calls as key facts, and
recall had exactly one lens — best-match-plus-recency, which buries the half-forgotten
connection creative recall lives on. The vector geometry and ranking were innocent: an idea that
existed as a first-class memory recalled fine. The riff never lost the ranking race — it was
never minted as a memory. Four changes, all tuning-layer:

**1. Tier-1 `idea` category (the unlock).** "A creative insight, cross-domain connection,
inspiration, aesthetic observation, or what-if — an idea seed, not yet a decision or task."
Perpetual (no decay — an idea ages INTO relevance; the half-forgotten connection is the valuable
one), ranking prior 0.85 (above operational facts, below doctrine/incident/decision), regex
auto-suggester triggers on ideation phrasing ("reminds me of", "what if", "riffing on"...), LLM
classifier target, bridge enums (bridge 2.13.0). Guard: `idea` is ordinary chat vocabulary, so
the classifier's chatty-reply parser only accepts it as a sole-token answer — "i have no idea"
must not classify anything.

**2. The Muse (creative distiller).** Originally specced as Dreamer Stage 0.8; built instead as
the Analyst's sibling lens in `analyst.py` — discovery during build: the Analyst already had the
batching, dedup gate, deterministic ids, redaction, breaker isolation, and read-once bookkeeping
the Muse needs, AND it reads ALL `session_log` including the chat-first agents' captureCall
streams that Stage 0.7 structurally cannot see. Same machinery, opposite temperament: where the
Analyst is forbidden to bridge two statements into a third, bridging statements is exactly what
the Muse is for. It NOTICES, never INVENTS (every note must point at material voiced in the
log), emits only `idea` notes with `classified_by="muse"`, keeps its own `muse_processed` marker
(both lenses read each log exactly once, independently). Gate: `muse.enabled` (default OFF)
pending review of `mnemo-cortex muse --agent <id>` — an always-dry-run audition command that
never touches the vec index (safe beside a live server).

**3. Riff-scale capture (mnemo-cc-sync).** The flat 300-char turn snippet treated conversation
as noise and tool calls as signal — inverted for creative users. Now role-aware: user turns keep
2000 chars (the riff is the most valuable text in the stream), assistant conversation turns
1200, pure tool echoes stay at 300. Batch budget 4000→12000. `MuseConfig.per_memory_chars=4000`
so the wider capture actually reaches the creative lens (the Analyst's 1200 would have cut the
riff body before the Muse ever read it).

**4. Recall `mode=explore` (the serendipity lens).** Focus answers "what matches best";
explore answers "what does this remind the store of": prefers the similarity band adjacent to
the pool's top hit (relative geometry — absolute thresholds died once already in v4.3.0),
ignores recency entirely, and favors rarely-recalled memories (novelty = inverted access).
Explore results still bump access counts, so repeated exploring naturally rotates through the
idea space. Noise band (sim < top−0.08) is hard-zeroed — serendipity is adjacency, not
randomness. Works even with composite ranking disabled (a mode that silently no-ops would be a
silent degradation). Exposed via `mode` on `/context` and `mnemo_recall` (bridge 2.13.0).

## v4.7.1 (2026-07-02) — Stage 0.7 first-live-run fix: strict=False JSON parse + bigger output budget

**Problem.** The first live Stage 0.7 run lost 2 of 3 sessions to "JSON parse failed, nothing
salvageable": the judge emits raw newlines inside JSON string values (multi-line lesson text —
one failing item was literally `bash-quoting-collision`), strict json rejects the first object,
so even object-by-object salvage recovered zero.

**Fix.** `_parse_fact_array` parses with `strict=False` on both the clean and salvage paths
(accepts control chars inside strings; Stage 0.5 benefits too), `STRATEGY_MAX_TOKENS` default
8192→16384 (the same output-truncation lesson Stage 0.5 learned in v4.2.3), and parse-failure
logs now show head AND tail. Regression-tested.

## v4.7.0 (2026-07-02) — Trajectory Phase 2: Dreamer strategy distillation (Stage 0.7)

**Problem.** Phase 1 (v4.5.0) captures task recipes only when an agent explicitly calls
`mnemo_save_trajectory` — learning the agent doesn't think to save evaporates with the session.
The original Phase-2 spec assumed the Developer Dump would supply raw trajectories, but the dump
hook lives in the MCP bridge and only sees Mnemo tool calls (325 lines in 7 weeks for the busiest
agent) — it cannot reconstruct how a task was actually executed, and it accumulates on the agent's
machine, not the Dreamer's.

**Fix.** New Dreamer **Stage 0.7** distills strategies from the jsonl-sync **session streams**
already landing server-side as `session_log` writebacks (ordered tool sequences + the agent's
narrated turns, grouped by a real `session_id`). Per session, an LLM judge segments the stream at
task boundaries (context switches — never fixed windows, which split tasks into fragments), then
conservatively emits 0..N strategy items from clear successes AND clear failures. Items are stored
in the existing Phase-1 trajectory store via `/trajectory/save` (`source="dreamer"`,
`derived_from=success|failure`, `evidence_source`) and recalled through `mnemo_recall_trajectory`
— zero new retrieval infrastructure, no new L2 category. Reinforcement per Opie bus #995:
`/trajectory/recall` now bumps a `recall_stats.json` sidecar (atomic tmp+rename; counters never
touch the append-only recipe JSONLs), and a nightly curation pass flags trajectories with no
save/recall activity in 90 days for review — flag-only, nothing is auto-deleted. Gated by
`MNEMO_DREAM_STRATEGIES` (default OFF); `--dry-run` runs distillation and prints items without
posting (the human quality gate).

## v4.6.0 (2026-07-01) — nomic task-prefix fix + full store re-embed (`migrate reindex`)

**Problem.** The live embedder is ollama `nomic-embed-text`, which REQUIRES task-instruction
prefixes (`search_query: ` for queries, `search_document: ` for stored content) — and ollama does
not add them. Mnemo embedded both sides bare, compressing the whole similarity band to ~0.49–0.62
(gibberish ~0.50, on-topic 0.51–0.58), so good recalls and noise overlapped. That compression is
what forced v4.3.0's dead `relevance_floor` and v4.5.3's noise-limited `gap_threshold` nudge.

**Fix.** Threaded a `task_type` ("query"/"document") through the embed path; the prefix is applied
INSIDE `OllamaEmbedding` on the API payload only — callers' text, `vec_sources.text`, and the
4000-char truncation math stay un-prefixed. Default is "document" so a missed call site degrades to
the already-correct document case, never a mis-prefixed query. The Google fallback maps to its
native `taskType` (`RETRIEVAL_QUERY`/`RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT`) instead of a text prefix; other
providers accept-and-ignore. Because the existing store was embedded prefix-less, query prefixes
alone would create a train/serve mismatch — so this ships with **`mnemo-cortex migrate reindex`**:
per-tenant backup (memory/ + vec_index.sqlite + trajectories/), re-embed of every memory AND
trajectory through the PRIMARY embedder only (aborts loudly if it goes down — a mid-run fallback
would write mixed-space vectors, the exact corruption being removed), then an L1/L2 cache wipe
(they hold old-space document embeddings; L3 re-embeds live and self-heals). Idempotent and
resumable. Run offline (server stopped): old and new vectors have no consistent-recall path while
they coexist.

**Post-migration measurement (2026-07-01, deployed to IGOR-2, all 32 tenants / 8,452 memories
re-embedded, zero failures).** 8-probe battery vs the pre-migration baseline: on-topic content
lifted off the noise floor in ABSOLUTE terms (flat on-topic pools 0.55–0.57 and standout tops
0.61–0.62, vs noise unchanged at ~0.50–0.52), but gap SHAPES were stable (whiff ~0.01, rich pools
~0.02, standouts 0.04–0.05). The spec's guess that gaps would widen to 0.05–0.10 did not hold —
raising `gap_threshold` would fire expansion on healthy recalls. **`gap_threshold` stays 0.02**,
confirmed by measurement. Side effect worth knowing: absolute relevance is meaningful again
(whiff tops ≤0.52 vs on-topic ≥0.55), so an absolute floor is viable in the future if ever wanted
— not built, per the locked keep-it-simple design.

## v4.5.3 (2026-07-01) — Query-expansion `gap_threshold` retuned for IGOR-2's nomic embedder (0.03 → 0.02)

**Problem.** The Thesaurus Loop's whiff trigger (`should_expand`) escalates when a first pass is
FLAT: `top_relevance - median_relevance < gap_threshold`. That `gap_threshold=0.03` was calibrated
against artforge's embedder. Mnemo now runs on IGOR-2 with a local `nomic-embed-text` embedder whose
similarity band is even more compressed — measured **~0.49–0.62** across 8 live recall probes. At that
compression the top-vs-pack gaps run: clear-standout on-topic **0.05–0.07**, flat-but-on-topic **~0.02**,
whiff/gibberish **~0.01**. So `0.03` expanded flat-but-on-topic pools too (gap 0.02 < 0.03) —
reintroducing the hot-path tax the escalation design exists to avoid.

**Fix.** `gap_threshold` **0.03 → 0.02**. Still catches every measured true whiff (all 0.01) and empty
passes, but spares flat on-topic recalls the wasted Flash call; clear-standout recalls (gap ≥0.05)
continue to skip. The near-free false-positive on a genuinely uniform pool is still accepted per the
locked design (one ~$0.001 Flash call; max-relevance merge makes the merged result identical to not
expanding). Config-only default, tunable without redeploy. Timeout unchanged — the expansion call is
still OpenRouter `gemini-2.5-flash`, which the local-embedder migration doesn't touch. Regression test
pins the new 0.02 boundary. **Follow-up queued** (bus #969, Opie): add nomic's `search_query:` /
`search_document:` task prefixes to decompress the similarity band and make the whiff signal robust
rather than noise-limited.

## v4.5.2 (2026-06-30) — Embedder refuse-and-alert (foundation-audit 4.5) + silence non-git-repo dreamer noise (2.4)

**Problem.** On embedder failure the resilient chain failed over to any configured fallback and
returned its vector unchecked. If that fallback's dimension differed from the index's locked 768-dim,
the write hit `VecDimMismatch` deep in the insert path (ugly 500, no operator signal); and a total
embedder outage raised a bare `RuntimeError` with no alert — the memory could quietly stop accepting
saves with nobody told (audit 4.5). Separately, the nightly dreamer logged "⚠️ not a git repo —
skipped" for any watched path without a `.git` (e.g. IGOR-2's `BRAIN_DIR` is the `brain/` subdir),
cluttering every brief (audit 2.4).

**Fix.** `ResilientEmbedding` self-calibrates a dimension lock from the first successful **primary**
embed and rejects any later vector (primary or fallback) of a different dimension — a wrong-dim
fallback can never reach the index. When nothing yields a valid-dim vector the embed is **REFUSED**
(`EmbeddingRefused`, a `RuntimeError` subclass) and a rate-limited Discord alert fires (webhook from
`MNEMO_ALERT_DISCORD_WEBHOOK` → `MNEMO_DREAM_DISCORD_WEBHOOK`; fail-safe if unset). Never silently
lose context, never corrupt the index — the operator decides whether to wait or continue aware.
`vec.py`'s 768-dim check remains the deeper backstop. Dreamer now skips non-git paths silently. Tests
added for lock / same-dim-serve / wrong-dim-refuse / all-down-refuse+alert.

## bridge v2.12.2 (2026-06-29) — Fix: agent_startup overflowed the tool-result cap on large brain files

**Problem.** `_runStartup` read the session lane file and the cross-agent docs (`active.md` etc.)
whole into the boot block. Those files grow unbounded — CC's `cc-session.md` reached ~572 KB /
4,656 lines and `active.md` ~126 KB — so `agent_startup` returned ~721 K chars, blew past the MCP
tool-result cap, and had to be read back via a subagent every single session boot (audit finding
3.3). The relevant content (newest session + kickstart) sat at the top, buried under stale history.

**Fix.** Added `readBrainCapped()` — each brain file in the boot block is capped to its most-recent
`STARTUP_FILE_CAP` (40 KB) slice (these files are newest-first, so the top is the relevant part),
with a truncation marker pointing to `read_brain_file` for the full content. Applied to the lane
file and the CLAUDE/active/people/doctrines reads. Takes effect on next bridge restart. Operational
follow-up: periodically archive old sessions out of the lane file too.

## bridge v2.12.1 (2026-06-29) — Fix: auto-capture trail silently dropped on a /writeback failure

**Problem.** The MCP bridge's auto-capture ring buffer (`flushBuffer`) `splice(0)`'d all pending
tool-call entries into a local array and POSTed them to `/writeback`. On a failed POST (server
restart, transient network, embedder stall) the `catch` only wrote to stderr — the spliced-out
batch was then discarded. Result: every tool-call trail captured since the last successful flush
was lost whenever a flush failed. A silent ingest-path loss, surfaced by the foundation audit
(finding 1.3).

**Fix.** On flush failure, re-queue the failed batch at the front of the buffer (preserving order),
cap the backlog at `MAX_BUFFER_BACKLOG = 200` so a prolonged outage can't grow memory unboundedly
(keeps the most-recent activity), and self-schedule a retry so recovery doesn't depend on the next
captured call arriving. Verified in isolation: re-queue preserves order, retry drains on recovery,
and the cap drops only the oldest entries. Takes effect on next bridge restart.

## v4.5.1 (2026-06-26) — Fix: nightly dream silently dropped on Windows (cp1252 file-write crash)

**Problem.** After the artforge→IGOR-2 server cutover (2026-06-24), the nightly Dreamer ran on
Windows for the first time. On 6/25 and 6/26 it crashed at the very end with
`UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '→' (→)` — `Path.write_text()`
defaults to the platform encoding, which is **cp1252** on Windows (it was utf-8 on artforge, so
this never bit). The dream text routinely contains `→`, emoji, and smart quotes, so the write
blew up. Damage was masked three ways: (1) facts were already `post_facts()`'d *before*
`write_dream()`, so the store looked fine; (2) the `.md` was opened in `'w'` mode and truncated
to **0 bytes** before the crash, so a file existed (just empty) — `agent_startup` then showed no
dream brief; (3) the PowerShell launcher exited 0 regardless of Python's exit code, so the
Scheduled Task reported **Last Result: 0 (success)** while Python exited 1. A silent drop.

**Fix.** Force `encoding="utf-8"` on every raw-text `write_text()` in code that runs on Windows:
`mnemo-dream.py` (dream `.md` + JSON record), `agentb/refresher.py` and `agentb/cli.py` (context
bundles), `mnemo-wiki-compile.py` (wiki pages + index). `json.dumps()` writes were already
ASCII-safe (`ensure_ascii=True`) and left as-is. **Second site:** the dreamer's own `stdout` was
also unguarded — the final `print(dream_text)` / `print(sync_block)` crashed on `→`/`✅` (cp1252)
*after* the brief + writeback had already succeeded, so the run still exited 1. Added the same
issue-#3 `sys.stdout`/`stderr` utf-8 reconfigure that `cli.py` already carries, at the top of
`mnemo-dream.py`. The Dreamer's PS launcher on IGOR-2 was also fixed to propagate `$LASTEXITCODE`
so future failures surface in the task result instead of hiding behind a green checkmark. Note: facts for 6/25–6/26 were retained (saved
pre-crash); only those two human-readable briefs + their L2 writeback were lost.

## v4.5.0 (2026-06-25) — Trajectory Learning Phase 1: agents capture & recall proven recipes

**Problem.** Mnemo stores *what happened* (memories) and *why* (decisions/doctrines), but the
step-by-step **recipe** of a task that went well evaporated with the session. An agent that
figured out, say, how to repoint a misconfigured bus path, or how to run a Shopify fix, had no
way to hand that working sequence to its future self or to another session — it re-derived the
approach from scratch every time. Today's "procedural" memory was only hand-authored brain-file
doctrines, never learned from experience.

**Fix — two explicit MCP tools backed by per-agent trajectory storage.** (Opie spec
2026-06-25, Guy-approved.)
- **`mnemo_save_trajectory`** — called AFTER a task succeeds. Captures `task_type`,
  `task_description`, the ordered `steps` (action / tool_used / args / result_summary),
  `outcome`, and an honest 1–5 self-`rating` (plus optional token_cost / model / duration).
- **`mnemo_recall_trajectory`** — called BEFORE a similar task. Embeds an NL `query`, returns
  the nearest recipes ranked by **(1) semantic similarity, (2) rating, (3) recency**, filtered
  to `min_rating` (default 3) and optionally a `task_type`. Each result carries the full step
  sequence — the proven recipe.

**Storage** mirrors Mnemo's existing "JSONL is disk truth, sqlite-vec is the index" philosophy:
append-only crash-safe `{agent_data_dir}/trajectories/{task_type}.jsonl` (a torn final line is
skipped on read, never corrupting earlier entries) plus a per-tenant `traj_index.sqlite`
VecStore over each recipe's embedding text. `task_type` becomes a filename (sanitized to block
path traversal) and rides the vec `category` column so recall filters by type inside the kNN.

**Boundaries (Phase 1):** no export, no fine-tuning, **no automatic capture** (agents explicitly
save when they judge a task went well), no cross-agent sharing — each agent's trajectories are
its own. The later ReasoningBank-style auto-distill design (Dreamer Stage 0.7) can feed this same
store as a future phase.

New module `agentb/trajectory.py`; endpoints `POST /trajectory/save` + `POST /trajectory/recall`;
bridge tools at v2.12.0. 21 new tests (store unit + HTTP endpoint round-trip, min_rating /
task_type filters, tenant isolation, crash-safe malformed-line recovery).

## v4.4.1 (2026-06-23) — Native Windows: cross-platform Passport file locking

**Problem.** The server failed to import on native Windows. `agentb.server.create_app()`
mounts the Passport router, whose `passport/storage.py` did `import fcntl` at module load.
`fcntl` is Unix-only, so the import raised `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fcntl'`
and the whole server refused to start — blocking the Mnemo Cortex server from running as a
native Python process on Windows (everything else in `agentb` already imports and runs there,
including the `sqlite-vec` vector index).

**Fix — abstract the three advisory locks behind platform helpers.**
- **POSIX is byte-for-byte unchanged**: `_lock_shared`/`_lock_exclusive`/`_unlock` wrap the
  same `fcntl.flock` LOCK_SH/LOCK_EX/LOCK_UN calls as before.
- **Windows** (no `fcntl`) falls back to `msvcrt` for the exclusive whole-file lock that guards
  read-modify-write (`exclusive_lock`) and atomic writes. The shared *read* lock degrades to a
  no-op there — safe because `_atomic_yaml_write` already writes via a temp file + `os.replace`
  (atomic on Windows too), so a reader can never observe a torn file.

No new dependency; no behavior change on Linux/macOS. This makes the Mnemo Cortex server
natively Windows-capable.

**Known follow-up:** `mnemo-wiki-compile.py` (a standalone CLI tool, not in the server import
path) still `import fcntl` for its single-instance run lock; it is unaffected by this change and
will get the same treatment separately.

## v4.4.0 (2026-06-17) — Recalibrate the Thesaurus Loop: gap signal, not an absolute floor

**Problem.** The v4.3.0 query expansion shipped but **fired 0× in production** — diagnosed
by replaying real recalls against the live store. Escalation gated on an *absolute* top
relevance below `expansion.relevance_floor` (0.5), but this embedder compresses scores into
a narrow band where good recalls and noise **overlap**: gibberish landed at ~0.50, a real
on-topic hit ("Hoffman bedding") at 0.512 — indistinguishable. No fixed absolute floor can
separate signal from noise here: 0.5 never fires, 0.53 fires on good queries too, 0.55 fires
on everything. The escalation-only design quietly degraded to never-escalate.

**Fix — trigger on the relative top-vs-pack gap, which is embedder-agnostic.** A strong recall
*peaks above its own pack* regardless of where the absolute band sits; a whiff comes back
*flat*. So expansion now escalates when the pass is **empty**, or when
`top_relevance - median_relevance < expansion.gap_threshold` (default 0.03). Strong recalls
in live data peak ~0.04 over the median; 0.03 separates them. The signal doesn't depend on
the score distribution's absolute location, so it survives an embedder swap.

- **`should_expand`** drops the absolute-relevance comparison; adds the `top - median` gap
  check. Word-count gate (<3 words skip) and Flash isolation (own timeout/breaker/fallback)
  are unchanged. New `median_relevance` helper alongside `top_relevance`.
- **Accepted false-positive (per design):** a uniform pool — including a single result, where
  `top == median` — escalates. The cost is one ~$0.001 Flash call, and max-relevance
  `merge_passes` makes the merged result identical to not expanding. No companion absolute
  threshold, no self-calibration — kept simple deliberately.
- **Rest of the pipeline untouched:** `merge_passes`, the tier dedup, the LRU, and
  `expand_query` are byte-identical to v4.3.0.

**Config.** `expansion.relevance_floor` is **removed**; `expansion.gap_threshold` (default
0.03) replaces it. The config loader filters unknown keys, so a stale `relevance_floor:` in a
deployed YAML is silently ignored (no crash) rather than honored.

**Tests.** `tests/test_query_expansion.py` grows to 27 cases: gap-trigger units (flat→expand,
clear-winner→skip, single-result→expand, threshold configurable, exact-boundary), a
`median_relevance` unit, and two end-to-end tests through the real L3 cosine path — a
discriminating embedder proving a clear winner skips expansion, and the v4.3.0 regression
(four uniformly-*high* hits the old floor passed at 1.0 ≥ 0.5 but which are a flat pool) now
correctly escalating. Full suite green except the pre-existing passport #425 red.

**Also** de-drifts the `/health` + startup-banner version strings (were stuck at 4.3.0) and
the CLI `--version` / `pyproject` (were 4.3.1) up to 4.4.0.

## v4.3.1 (2026-06-16) — Fix: Windows CLI crash on redirected stdout (issue #3)

**Problem.** Any CLI command that prints the banner — notably `mnemo-cortex watch` — crashed
on Windows when stdout was redirected to a file or pipe (a Scheduled Task, a service, or
`... *>> watch.log`) with `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '⚡'`.
Redirected stdout is not a real console, so it falls back to the system codepage (cp1252),
which can't encode the banner's ⚡ (U+26A1). The process exited before the watcher loop ever
started, so **auto-capture was silently dead in any scheduled/piped Windows setup** — exactly
the out-of-the-box story Windows users expect after `mnemo-cortex init`.

**Fix.** At CLI startup, reconfigure stdout/stderr to utf-8 with `errors="replace"` (belt),
and construct rich's `Console` with `legacy_windows=False` / `force_terminal=False` when
stdout is not a TTY (suspenders), keeping it off the Windows legacy-console path that grabs
the file handle directly. Both are no-ops on a normal interactive terminal. Verified on
Windows 11 / Python 3.13: the redirected banner and `--help` now render as plain text instead
of crashing. Also de-drifts the version strings in `pyproject.toml` (was 4.1.1) and the CLI
`--version` (was 4.0.3) up to the real current release.

## v4.3.0 (2026-06-15) — The Thesaurus Loop: query expansion on a whiff

**Problem.** A recall commits to one phrasing. If a memory was filed under different
words than the query used, the vector match is weak or misses entirely — *assumption
misalignment* between how you ask and how it was stored. (Opie searched 3× for the
transcript pipeline because "transcribe routine" didn't match "transcript processing
pipeline.")

**Fix — multi-query retrieval (RAG-Fusion), gated by escalation.** The standard single
-query recall runs first, unchanged. Only when it **whiffs** — zero results, or a top
raw relevance below `expansion.relevance_floor` (default 0.5) — does the handler fan the
query into a few alternative phrasings (one isolated Flash call), search each, and fuse
the passes. Escalation means a good search pays **nothing** (the expansion branch is never
reached), which makes default-ON safe.

- **`merge_passes` — max-relevance-per-memory_id (the crux).** Cross-pass fusion keeps the
  highest-relevance instance of a memory across phrasings, not the first seen. A dict
  update preserves insertion order, so a single pass is byte-identical to the v4.1 pooled
  re-rank handler. The retrieval itself is factored into `_retrieve_for_embedding` so the
  same tier stack (HOT/L1/VEC/L2/L3, with its intra-pass dedup) runs once per phrasing.
  (One narrow exception to "byte-identical": two HOT exchanges from the same session with
  an identical truncated prompt+response now collapse to one — a dedup improvement, not a
  data-loss regression.)
- **`expand_query` — isolated, fail-safe.** One OpenRouter Flash call (`google/gemini-2.5
  -flash` by default), reusing whatever OpenRouter key the reasoning chain already carries.
  Hard `timeout_ms` (default 2500 — tuned up from 800 after a live deploy showed Flash
  latency straddling ~1s), kept entirely off the shared reasoner circuit breaker (a
  Flash hiccup must never poison preflight/classification), and LRU-cached by normalized
  query so repeat recalls (`agent_startup`, etc.) are free. Any failure/timeout/no-key →
  `[]` → the handler behaves exactly as it did pre-v4.2.
- **Live-path only.** A `batch: true` recall (backfill, scripted sweeps) never expands, and
  callers can force it off per request with `expand: false`.

**Config.** New `expansion` block: `enabled` (default true), `relevance_floor`,
`max_variants` (4), `timeout_ms` (2500), `min_query_words` (3 — short/entity lookups skip
expansion), `model`, optional `api_key`/`api_base`.

**Tests.** `tests/test_query_expansion.py` (19 cases): max-relevance merge incl. single-pass
identity and HOT dedup; the escalation trigger (short/zero/weak/strong); `expand_query`
no-key no-op, timeout = `[]` (no regression), parsing/cap/drop-original, LRU cache, failures
uncached; and `/context` end-to-end — escalation fires on a whiff, never for batch /
`expand=false` / a strong first pass. Full suite green (the pre-existing local
`pytest-asyncio` env failures aside).

**Deploy.** Shipped to artforge default-ON (escalation makes that safe — zero cost on good
searches). Instant-off via `expansion.enabled=false`. The live recall path serving every
agent, so it went out as a deliberate, gated step with a post-deploy `/context` smoke test.

## v4.2.3 (2026-06-14) — Dreamer: salvage truncated fact arrays + raise the output ceiling (quality recall)

**Problem (found in the 2026-06-14 morning verify).** The v4.2.2 chunking fix kept one
truncated chunk from dropping a whole agent's facts — but its assumption ("each call's
output array fits well inside max_tokens") was too optimistic. The 06-14 run showed cc's
20K-char input chunks STILL overran the **4096-token** output cap, truncating mid-array at
output char ~10-13K. Each truncated chunk failed `json.loads` and returned `[]`, so cc kept
only **24 facts across 1/4 chunks** — the 3 truncated chunks lost every fact, *including the
complete objects that arrived before the cut.* Resilient, but lossy: ~75% of the night's cc
facts thrown away.

**Fix (two complementary changes — both needed).**
- **`_parse_fact_array` salvage parser.** On a clean parse, behaves like `json.loads`. On a
  truncated/corrupt array, walks complete top-level objects out of it with
  `JSONDecoder().raw_decode` and keeps every one before the cut — so a truncated chunk now
  yields N−1 facts instead of zero. Also wraps a bare object (LLM returned one fact, not an
  array) instead of discarding it. Stdlib-only, no new dependency. The parse site in
  `_extract_facts_from_section` now logs `salvaged N complete fact object(s)` (warn) on
  recovery and only returns `None` when nothing is recoverable.
- **Raise the fact-extraction output ceiling** from 4096 → **8192** tokens
  (`MNEMO_DREAM_FACT_MAX_TOKENS`, env-overridable). Facts are cheap output; the headroom lets
  most chunks finish cleanly so truncation becomes rare, and salvage makes the rare remainder
  near-lossless. Input chunking (`MNEMO_DREAM_FACT_CHUNK_CHARS=20000`) is unchanged.

**Tests.** 7 new cases in `tests/test_dream_cap.py` covering the two exact 06-14 truncation
shapes (unterminated string, cut-after-comma), bare-object wrap, unrecoverable garbage, empty
array, and end-to-end salvage through `_extract_facts_from_section`. Full dream suite: 20 pass.

## v4.2.2 (2026-06-13) — Dreamer: chunk Stage-0.5 fact extraction so a heavy day doesn't lose all its facts

**Problem (found in the 2026-06-13 morning verify).** Stage 0.5 (`extract_facts_for_agent`)
sent ALL of one agent's non-auto-capture entries to the LLM in a single call capped at
`max_tokens=4096` *output*. On a heavy day — cc had 165 entries / 64,470 chars after the
2026-06-12 redesign + fleet session — the model's JSON fact array overran the 4096-token
output cap, truncated mid-string ("Unterminated string"), `json.loads` failed, and
`extract_facts_for_agent` returned `[]` — losing **every** fact for that agent that night.
(The same truncation hit cc *and* opie on 2026-06-12.) The adaptive-halving backstop only
retries input-side context 400s, so an output truncation (HTTP 200 with a complete-but-
truncated body) never triggered it.

**Fix.**
- New `_chunk_memories_by_chars` splits an agent's entries into chunks bounded by
  `MNEMO_DREAM_FACT_CHUNK_CHARS` (default **20,000 chars**) so each call's output array fits
  well inside `max_tokens`. Chronological order preserved; a lone oversized memory becomes
  its own chunk (never silently dropped).
- New `_extract_facts_from_section` isolates call+parse+validate for one chunk and returns
  `None` on failure, so a parse failure now costs **one chunk**, not the whole agent's facts.
  `extract_facts_for_agent` accumulates across chunks and logs how many failed.
- Tests: `tests/test_dream_cap.py` +6 (chunk split / under-budget / oversized-single /
  order-preservation / multi-call-on-big-input [mutation: huge budget → 1 call → fails] /
  one-bad-chunk-doesn't-zero-the-agent). Full suite **230 pass, 1 known pre-existing fail**
  (passport #425).

**Not a bug:** the "no Discord beep overnight" noticed the same morning is by design — the
dreamer's beep is git-sync-activity-driven, so clean no-change nights (June 12 & 13) are
silent. The notifier is fine.

## v4.2.1 (2026-06-11) — Dreamer (mnemo-dream.py): stop one big agent from killing the nightly run

**Problem (found via bus #616 — "no Discord beeps overnight").** The nightly Dreamer
(`mnemo-dream.py`, cron 3:15) had silently been failing since ~June 9; its last successful
dream was June 8. Two faults, compounding:
- **One agent's volume overflowed the model.** Stage-1 synthesis builds one section per
  agent and sends it to a 1M-token model. opie's auto-capture had grown to **2081 entries /
  ~19MB / ~4.9M tokens** — a *single* agent's section blew past the context window and 400'd.
  The existing per-agent map-reduce split doesn't help when one agent alone overflows.
- **A per-agent failure aborted the whole run.** Stage-1 caught the 400 and then `sys.exit(1)`
  — so opie's failure killed the run before cc/dave/rocky's *successful* dreams could roll up
  or fire the notification. That's why there were no beeps: the run died before notifying
  (the Discord hook itself was fine — it posted a git-sync beep as recently as June 8). The
  stuck "last dream" timestamp also meant each retry harvested a larger window → death spiral.

**Fix.**
- `_build_agent_section` is now capped at `MNEMO_DREAM_MAX_AGENT_SECTION_CHARS` (default
  **1M chars** — cc's ~1.06M section synthesized fine; opie's 2.5M got a provider-side 400),
  **recency-first** — oldest entries dropped to fit, announced in the section header and
  logged (never silent).
- `_call_openrouter` now validates the 200 response has `choices` and raises a catchable
  `RuntimeError` if not. OpenRouter wraps some provider errors ("Provider returned error",
  code 400) in an HTTP 200 with no `choices`; the old code did `result["choices"][0]` → a
  raw **`KeyError` that escaped every per-stage handler and crashed the run** (the second
  fault, exposed once the cap got opie past the hard context limit).
- New `_call_openrouter_adaptive` halves the input and retries on size-related failures
  (context-length 400 **and** the provider-400/no-choices case), keeping the most-recent
  tail. Used by stage 0.5, stage 1, and the rollup.
- Stage 1 now **skips** a failed agent (`continue`) instead of `sys.exit(1)`; only aborts if
  *every* agent fails. One agent's failure can no longer suppress the others' notification.

Verified live on artforge: a manual run completes, advances state past the June-8 backlog,
and posts the git-sync Discord beep (HTTP 204) + bus notifications. This is the cron script
only — no server/API change, `/health` stays 4.2.0.

## v4.2.0 (2026-06-10) — VEC category pushdown (#468): the real fix for the L3 fall-through

**The problem.** The sqlite-vec (VEC) tier was **category-blind** — `search()` returned the
nearest top-k regardless of category, then `/context` filtered them *after the fact* by
reading each hit's JSON from disk. On a `session_log`-dominated store (cc: ~1,100 of ~2,540
memories are logs) the VEC top-k is almost entirely the hidden-by-default `session_log`
category, so a category-filtered recall got an all-hidden top-k → VEC contributed nothing →
the pool underfilled → `/context` fell through to **L3**, the disk-walk that embeds every
prefilter-passing file (O(store size) ollama calls = seconds). v4.1.1 capped L3 to 80 embeds
as a stopgap (cc 20s→6.2s) but that trades recall completeness for latency. This is the
structural fix.

**The fix.** `category` is now a column on `vec_sources`, filtered *inside* the kNN:
- **Schema v2** — additive `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN category TEXT`, idempotent on open. Old
  code ignores the column; search-without-category is byte-for-byte unchanged. Safe to deploy
  live (non-destructive).
- **`search(include_category=, exclude_categories=, overfetch_multiplier=)`** — with a filter,
  the kNN over-fetches `top_k × multiplier` (config `cache.vec_category_overfetch_multiplier`,
  default **5**) and filters by the column, returning the nearest `top_k` survivors. Filter
  semantics mirror the handler's predicate exactly (include requires an exact match; a
  NULL-category row is *not* excluded). If the filtered set is thin, the **partial set is
  returned — `/context` does not fall through to L3** when a category is pinned (partial beats
  a multi-second/timeout disk-walk).
- **Column stays disk-truth.** `upsert()` writes category; the writeback + archived-session
  paths pass it. The trap: reclassification rewrites the JSON category but historically left
  `vec_sources` untouched ("category is disk-only"). A stale column would *wrongly exclude* a
  reclassified memory — a silent recall false-negative. Closed with `update_category()`, fired
  from a new `on_reclassified` hook in `reclassify_memory_dir` (wired into both the dreamer
  pass and the `migrate reclassify` CLI). The handler's disk-truth `keep_chunk` remains the
  correctness authority, so the column can never cause a false *include*.
- **Deploy step** — `mnemo-cortex migrate vec-backfill [--agent X | --all]` (`backfill_categories`)
  populates the column from disk for existing rows. No embedding, single-row UPDATEs, idempotent,
  backs up the sqlite file first — safe to run while the server is up.

**Tests.** `test_vec.py`: column add/ALTER on a legacy v1 db, upsert+search carry category,
include/exclude pushdown, NULL-category not excluded, partial-when-thin, `update_category`
refresh + no-op, `backfill_categories` from disk. `test_context_vec_filter.py`: end-to-end
through `/context` — a pinned category does **not** call `l3_scan` (spied), while a plain
underfilling recall still does (guard is specific, doesn't over-suppress the escape hatch).
216 passing (lone pre-existing passport #425 failure aside).

**Follow-up.** Once verified live, raise the `l3_max_candidates` default (the v4.1.1 stopgap)
since L3 is no longer reached on category-filtered recall.

## v4.1.1 (2026-06-10) — bound the L3 disk-walk (cc recall latency) + warm-summary redaction

**The problem (found in the v4.1.0 deploy smoke test).** cc's `/context` took **20s**
— past the 10s MCP-bridge timeout — while opie/rocky/dave were 245–1776ms. Root cause:
L3 (`l3_scan`) is the disk-walk escape hatch, and it **embeds every prefilter-passing
file** in the store (O(store size) ollama calls). It only runs when the cheap tiers
underfill the pool. cc's store is **session_log-dominated**, so its VEC top-k is all
hidden-by-default → VEC contributes 0 → the pool underfills → L3 walks cc's 2,529-file
store and embeds hundreds of candidates. (Confirmed: `exclude_categories=[]` lets VEC
fill and cc drops to 269ms.) v4.1.0 didn't cause this — it *exposed* it by correctly
dropping the ~1,238 orphaned/deleted L2 entries that used to mask it.

**The fix (interim, until #468).**
- `l3_scan` now walks **newest-first** and caps the number of EMBEDS at
  `cache.l3_max_candidates` (default **80**). Recency order means the bounded sample
  keeps the most-recent (usually most-relevant) candidates, not an arbitrary
  filename-hash slice. Cheap reads/prefilter are not capped — only the expensive embed.
  `None` = uncapped (legacy callers / small stores). Wired through `/context`.
- The *real* fix is **vec category-pushdown (#468)** — filter session_log at the kNN
  level so cc's VEC returns the non-log gold directly and L3 is never reached. Promoted
  to next-up.
- Also folds in the v4.1 review remediation: the reasoner-generated **warm-session
  summary** now passes the redaction choke point before persist.

**Tests.** `test_agentb.py` L3 cap: `max_candidates` bounds `embed_fn` call count and
prefers recent files; uncapped default unchanged.

## v4.1.0 (2026-06-10) — the Fable pass: secrets, ranking, the Analyst, tier hygiene

A full-codebase review-and-improve pass. Five workstreams, each fixing a
problem the 2026-06-09 quality audit or live incidents had already paid for.

### Secret redaction at ingest (the two-leaks-in-one-week fix)
**The problem.** Auto-capture syncs terminal activity every 60s — including any
API key that gets printed. Zero detection anywhere in the pipeline; two real
key leaks in one week.
**The fix.** `agentb/redact.py` — every byte entering the store via
`/writeback` or `/ingest` passes through it first. Vendor-prefixed key shapes
(incl. `sk-or-v1-…` with hyphens — the exact shape the old grep mask missed),
PEM blocks, JWTs, Bearer headers, prefixed `NAME=value` assignments with a
placeholder/path allowlist. Redaction runs **before** classification so a
secret never rides a classify call to a remote LLM. Loud, never silent:
`redactions` count in responses + a warn log naming kinds (never values).
The nightly dreamer redacts its brief through the same module.

### Capture pause gate (security pause with a dead-man switch)
`POST /capture/pause {minutes, reason}` stops ambient capture server-wide
(`/ingest` + auto-capture-shaped `/writeback` are **discarded**, not buffered);
deliberate manual saves still land. Auto-resumes at expiry (default 15 min,
cap 4 h) via a lazy watchdog — forgetting to unpause can't lobotomize the
memory system. File-backed (survives restarts), state in `/health`, MCP
bridge tools `mnemo_capture_pause` / `mnemo_capture_resume` (bridge v2.11.0).

### Composite recall ranking (the 0.75/5 fix)
**The problem.** Results ranked by raw vector similarity in tier order; HOT
logs hardcoded to relevance 0.95. A hand-written doctrine at similarity 0.57
lost every top-5 slot to noise at 0.73.
**The fix.** `agentb/ranking.py` — score = similarity (0.55) + recency decay
(0.20) + category importance (0.15) + log-scaled access frequency (0.10),
weights in `RankingConfig`. `/context` restructured: tiers pool filtered
candidates (no sequential budget fill), one composite re-rank, one trim. New
`recall_stats` table per tenant tracks access counts. Missing metadata scores
neutral — pre-v3 records stay accessible. L3 disk-walk remains an escape
hatch (runs only when cheap tiers come up short).

### The Analyst (Phase 2 — smart session analysis)
The note-taker layer that didn't exist: on a maintenance cadence, reads each
tenant's unprocessed Tier-2 session logs once, LLM-extracts conservative
notes (decision/incident/doctrine/identity/relationship/topology/
current_state, confidence-gated, "empty list is the common correct answer"),
dedups by true cosine against existing memories, persists survivors as
Tier-1 with provenance (`source=inferred`, `classified_by=analyst`,
`derived_from=[ids]`). Tier 2 is never deleted. `AnalysisConfig` to tune.

### Tier hygiene + correctness fixes
- **Deleted memories no longer resurrect**: `resolve_disk_truth` now drops
  chunks whose memory JSON is gone (the June-9 purged `[AUTO-CAPTURE]` rows
  were still serving from L2 — observed live). Legacy L1/L2 entries with no
  `memory_id` get a content-shape check: auto-capture/auto-sync chunks are
  tagged `session_log` so default hiding finally applies to them.
- **L2 write path retired**: every save rewrote the tenant's entire L2
  `index.json` (cc's had grown to **43 MB — rewritten every minute** under
  the 60s auto-sync). New memories index into VEC only; L2 stays read-only
  for legacy entries.
- **HOT tier honesty**: live-session keyword hits are `category=session_log`
  (hidden by default like every other log; `exclude_categories=[]` opts in)
  at relevance 0.75 instead of an unconditional 0.95.
- **Real auth probes for the remaining providers**: Anthropic (`GET
  /v1/models`), Google (`GET /models?key=`), HuggingFace (whoami-v2 / TEI
  `/health`) — completing v4.0.3, all fail-closed.
- maintenance loop: batch embeds/summaries now `use_breaker=False`
  (batch-vs-live isolation); fixed latent unbound-variable crash; warm
  session archival finally summarizes (the hook existed, nothing wired it).
- config: `server.max_body_bytes` was silently ignored when set via YAML.
- `/context` chunks now carry `memory_id`. Behavior note: `total_found`
  now equals the number of chunks returned (post-rank trim), not the
  pre-trim pool size.
- Archived hot sessions stay recallable: each archived summary is
  persisted as a Tier-2 `session_log` memory in VEC (their old home was
  the retired L2 write path), where the Analyst distills them later.

**Tests.** 201 passing (was 152): redaction shapes incl. the sk-or-v1
regression, gate semantics, ranking contracts, analyst lifecycle, probe
fail-closed behavior, deleted-memory drop.

## v4.0.3 (2026-06-09) — fix: health_check never tested auth (a dead/401 key reported "healthy")

**The problem.** `OpenRouterReasoning.health_check()` (and the embedding variant)
returned `bool(self.config.api_key)` — proof a key *string exists*, never that it
*works*. So `/health` reported `reasoning healthy / active openrouter` while every
real call 401'd and silently failed over to ollama. In the field this made a
**transient** OpenRouter 401 look like a *dead key* for hours (the stack was fine,
running on fallback, but health hid which side was broken). Diagnosed during the
Session-73 key-rotation incident.

**The fix.**
- New `_openrouter_auth_ok(config)` helper: a real probe against OpenRouter's
  **credit-free `GET /key`** endpoint — `200` ⇒ the key authenticates, anything
  else (401, error, timeout) ⇒ unhealthy (fail *closed*, so the problem screams).
  Both `OpenRouterReasoning` and `OpenRouterEmbedding` health checks delegate to it.
- `health_check()` now reports the **primary's true health**, so a dead/401'ing
  primary surfaces as `degraded` instead of hiding behind the fallback.
- Because the probe is now a network call and `/health` is unauthenticated +
  monitor-polled, `ResilientReasoning`/`ResilientEmbedding` **TTL-cache** the result
  (30s) so health polling can't hammer OpenRouter.

**Not changed.** The other providers' `health_check` (OpenAI/Google/Anthropic/HF)
still return `bool(api_key)` — none are in our active stack; left for a follow-up
rather than widening this fix. Ollama's check was already a real ping.

**Tests.** `tests/test_health_check_probe.py` — 200⇒healthy, 401⇒unhealthy,
empty-key⇒unhealthy-without-network, network-error⇒fail-closed, provider delegation,
and the Resilient TTL cache (2nd hit served from cache, re-probes after expiry).

## v4.0.2 (2026-06-09) — fix: the L1 + L2 tiers also bypassed the category filter

**The problem.** v4.0.1 fixed the VEC tier, but a recall re-probe *still* leaked
`session_log` — this time arriving via `[L2]` and `[L1]`. Same root cause, two more
tiers: the category is canonical **on disk** (`memory/<id>.json`), but the
reclassification migration rewrote only those files, not the tier caches.
- **L2** carried the *pre-migration* category in its cached `metadata`, so a memory
  reclassified on disk still filtered against its stale category.
- **L1** bundles never stored a category *or* a `memory_id` at all — every L1 hit had
  `category=None`, which `passes_metadata` treats as "do not exclude," and with no
  `memory_id` it couldn't even be tied back to its memory file for validation.

**The fix.**
- New shared helper `resolve_disk_truth(chunk, memory_dir)` in `cache.py`: re-reads
  `category`/`source`/`created_at` from the chunk's memory JSON and mutates the chunk
  in place. Applied **inline in the `/context` L1 and L2 loops, before the trim** —
  not as a final pass over `all_chunks`. A final pass would be wrong: tiers fill the
  `max_results` budget sequentially, so leaky L1 hits would consume the budget and a
  late drop would leave results short with no backfill from VEC/L3. Resolving per-tier
  keeps the budget accounting honest, exactly like the v4.0.1 VEC fix.
- `L1Cache.add` now stores `memory_id` + `category`; `L1Cache.search` propagates them
  into `ContextChunk`; the maintenance-loop precache passes both from the disk record.
- VEC (v4.0.1) and the L3 disk-walk already read disk-truth, so they're untouched.

**Tests.** `tests/test_context_disk_truth_filter.py` — an L2 entry whose disk category
was reclassified to `session_log` is now excluded despite a stale cache; L1Cache
add/search round-trips `memory_id`+`category`; `resolve_disk_truth` overrides a stale
chunk category from disk.

## v4.0.1 (2026-06-09) — fix: the VEC tier bypassed the category filter (two-tier recall now works)

**The problem.** v4.0 reclassified the stores correctly, but a recall re-probe still
returned `session_log` noise in the top results. Root cause was older and deeper than
categorization: in `/context`, the **VEC (sqlite-vec) tier built its result chunks
without a `category`** (`ContextChunk(... )` with no `category=`/`provenance_source=`).
The metadata filter treats a `None` category as "don't exclude" (`if category and
category in effective_exclude`), so **every vector hit sailed past the `session_log`
exclusion — and past the source/stale filters too.** The L3 disk-walk got the
metadata prefilter in v3.3.1; the VEC path never did. This is what the memory-quality
audit's low recall score was actually measuring: the session-log firehose arriving via
VEC regardless of how anything was tagged.

**The fix.**
- In the `/context` VEC loop, load each hit's `category` + `source` from its memory
  JSON (the `VecHit` already carries `source_file` + `created_at`), compute `age_days`
  and `stale_warning` (`compute_stale_warning`), and pass them to `ContextChunk` — so
  `keep_chunk`/`passes_metadata` filters VEC hits exactly like every other tier. Cheap:
  only the over-fetched hits get a small metadata read, no extra embeds.
- Net: default recall (`exclude_categories=['session_log']`) finally hides Tier-2 logs;
  reclassified Tier-1 facts surface instead of being crowded out.
- Also fixed a stray hardcoded `version="3.3.1"` in the `/health` response (missed in
  the v4.0.0 drift sweep); all version strings now read 4.0.1.
- Test: `test_context_vec_filter.py` proves a `session_log` vec hit is excluded by
  default and returned when `exclude_categories=[]`.

## v4.0.0 (2026-06-09) — LLM-powered Smart Ingestion + reclassification migration

**The problem.** A memory-quality audit across four agent stores proved ambient recall is
broken. Of 16 representative recall queries against a real store, an average of **0.75 of the
top-5** results were useful; on **6 of 16 the right answer never surfaced**. Root cause is
*categorization*, not search: the regex auto-suggester (`provenance.suggest_category`) silently
returns `unknown` whenever it can't keyword-match, so 31–75% of every store sat uncategorized.
Real memories ("Tier 1": decisions, doctrines, topology, relationships) and raw session logs
("Tier 2") then shared one bucket and competed for the same top-k slots — the logs, by volume,
won. Every operator hits this.

**The fix (smart ingestion — three tracks, all reusing the existing reasoning provider):**
- **Save-time classification** (`agentb/classify.py`, wired into `/writeback`). A cheap noise
  pre-filter (`is_routine_log`) demotes raw tool/session logs to `session_log` for FREE — the
  firehose never costs an LLM call. Everything else is classified into one of the eight real
  categories by the reasoning LLM (already configured — OpenRouter/Gemini-Flash). Explicit
  caller categories still win; on LLM failure it falls back to the regex suggester and flags the
  memory `needs_reclassification`. Result: **zero new `unknown` memories**. Gated by
  `classification.enabled` (default on; disable for legacy regex-only behavior).
- **Migration CLI** (`mnemo-cortex migrate reclassify`, `agentb/migrate.py`). One-time sweep that
  reclassifies every `unknown`/routine-log memory in a store. Rewrites only the JSON `category`
  field — embeddings and `vec_sources` are never touched (category is disk-only metadata read at
  recall time), so there is no vector loss. Backs up `memory/` + `vec_index.sqlite` first;
  `--dry-run` previews the before→after spread; `--all` does every store. Default DEMOTES logs
  (Tier 2 is the archive, retained); `--purge-noise` deletes only empty/sentinel rows.
- **Dreamer reclassification pass** (`maintenance_loop`). ~Hourly safety net that reclassifies
  any straggler `unknown`/flagged memory the live path missed, capped per cycle.
- **Breaker isolation:** `ResilientReasoning.generate` gains `use_breaker=False` (mirrors the
  embedding path) so batch reclassification can't trip the live preflight circuit breaker.
- **Two-tier recall** now works as intended: default recall excludes `session_log` (= Tier 1);
  `exclude_categories=[]` returns Tier 1 + Tier 2.
- Version drift fixed: pyproject, CLI, and the MCP bridge all aligned to **4.0.0**.
- Tests: `test_classify.py` + `test_migrate.py` (19 new) — noise pre-filter, LLM/regex/invalid
  paths, dry-run writes nothing, backup, purge-only-sentinels. Full suite green.

## v3.3.1 (2026-05-30) — perf: push the metadata filter into the L3 scan, before the embed

**The problem.** A cross-agent recall *with a category filter* timed out from the
MCP bridge, while the same query hit the artforge REST endpoint directly in
~0.1s. The Mnemo log showed ~17 sequential `embedder.embed` calls per request.
Root cause: `l3_scan` embedded **every** memory file on disk to score it, and the
category/source/age/stale filter only ran *afterward* (`keep_chunk`, post-recall).
So a query that wanted one category still paid to embed every other category —
and over the bridge's tighter timeout, that serial embed loop blew the budget.

**The fix (no behavior change in results, only in cost):**
- Every check in the recall filter (`source`, `category`, excluded categories,
  `max_age_days`, `exclude_stale`) is **metadata-only** — none needs an embedding.
  Extracted them into a single `passes_metadata(...)` predicate in the `/context`
  handler; `keep_chunk` now delegates to it (one source of truth).
- `l3_scan` gained an optional `prefilter` parameter. It now computes each
  candidate's metadata (category, source, age, stale) from disk *before* the
  embed, and skips `embed_fn` entirely for candidates the prefilter rejects.
  `/context` passes `passes_metadata` straight through.
- Net: a category-filtered L3 scan embeds only the matching candidates instead of
  the whole directory. No prefilter → embeds all (backward compatible).
- Tests: `TestL3FilterPushdown` proves a 3-file dir with a single matching
  category triggers exactly one `embed` call (was three), plus the no-prefilter
  embeds-all backward-compat case. Full suite green (66 + 44).

## v3.3.0 (2026-05-30) — public Facts seeder + install wiring

**The problem.** An empty Phase 3 Facts table is a trap. Recall (fuzzy) and
Facts (exact) answer different questions, but when no canonical Fact exists, a
stale session-log memory wins a lookup it should lose — an agent "remembers" an
old model name or a retired port because nothing contradicted it. Every operator
hits this; the fix (seed the truths you already know at `confidence=verified`)
existed only as private Project Sparks tooling.

**What changed (additive — new `tools/`, no service-code behavior change):**
- `tools/seed-facts.py` — generalized loader. Reads a YAML of
  `(entity, attribute, value)` claims and asserts each as a Fact. Idempotent:
  re-runs skip matches, report contradictions, and write nothing in `--dry-run`.
  Runs on the bundled `httpx` + `pyyaml` (no new deps). Local-first
  (`MNEMO_URL` default `http://127.0.0.1:50001`); optional `MNEMO_AUTH_TOKEN`
  sent as `X-API-KEY` for auth-enforcing (non-loopback) deployments.
- `tools/seed-facts.example.yaml` — worked example with generic role names,
  including the high-value "retired entity" supersession pattern.
- `tools/seed-facts-post-commit.sh` + `tools/seed-facts-nightly.sh` — opt-in git
  post-commit hook and nightly cron that re-seed when the YAML changes.
  Self-contained, env-configurable, no scheduler assumptions.
- `tools/README.md` — quick start, env reference, idempotency/conflict notes.
- `robot.install` gains a `facts_seed` block (disabled by default). When
  enabled, `robot-install.sh` runs the seeder after the smoke test and can
  install the post-commit hook and/or nightly cron. Best-effort: a seeding
  hiccup is reported in its own `facts_seed` step but never fails the install.
- `robot.info` / `llms.txt` refreshed: version bumped to match the package
  (the manifest had drifted to 3.1.0), `facts_seed` documented in the install
  block, a new common-question on seeding, `pyyaml` added to the dependency list.

## v3.2.0 (2026-05-29) — dreamer: opt-in git-sync wedge

**The problem.** The nightly Dreamer runs `mnemo-dream.py` from a checkout on
the host machine. Two drift modes are invisible to it: (1) the Dreamer's own
checkout going stale or divergent from the repo (this actually happened — a
checkout drifted 35 commits behind with uncommitted local edits, so the live
Dreamer silently lacked features that had shipped), and (2) a brain/plan repo
edited on one machine but never pushed, so the next machine pulls stale state.
The facts seeder closes recall-side drift but can't see git state.

**What changed (additive, opt-in, default-off):**
- New `check_git_sync()` in `mnemo-dream.py` reports, per watched repo, whether
  the working tree is dirty, has unpushed commits, or is behind its upstream.
  Upstream is resolved via `@{u}` so it works whether the branch tracks
  `origin/main` or `origin/master`.
- Watched repos default to the Dreamer's own checkout plus the brain repo when
  `BRAIN_DIR` is set; `MNEMO_DREAM_GIT_SYNC_REPOS` (comma-separated paths)
  overrides.
- Results are always logged and appended to the printed dream report; drift
  (any `⚠️`) is also pushed to the bus + Discord webhook via `notify_git_sync()`,
  mirroring the existing `notify_contradictions` best-effort contract. Clean
  nights stay quiet.
- Gated behind `MNEMO_DREAM_GIT_SYNC_CHECK` (`1`/`true`/`yes`). Fully
  best-effort: every git call is timeout-bounded and exception-guarded, so the
  check can never crash the dream run.

**Scope note.** Each checkout only sees its *own* local git state. An
artforge-side check catches "behind remote" and that host's own dirty/unpushed
state; catching another machine's *uncommitted* edits requires running the
check on that machine too. No server/API change — Dreamer script only.

## v3.1.3 (2026-05-28) — auth: clients authenticate with `MNEMO_AUTH_TOKEN`

Defense-in-depth on top of network controls (firewall / loopback bind). The
auth middleware already shipped — when `server.auth_token` is set, every
endpoint except `/health` requires the token via either `X-API-KEY` or
`Authorization: Bearer`. This release teaches the bundled clients to send it,
so token enforcement can be enabled without breaking the mesh.

**Clients now send the token (opt-in — silent when no token is present):**
- **MCP bridge** (`integrations/mcp-bridge/server.js`) — reads
  `MNEMO_AUTH_TOKEN` from env, else `~/.mnemo-auth-token` (mode 0600), and
  sends it as `X-API-KEY` on every request. Reading from a single dotfile
  keeps the secret out of each agent's MCP config.
- **Dreamer** (`mnemo-dream.py`) — sends the token on its `/writeback` and
  `/facts` calls.

**Enabling auth (safe rollout):** clients can be configured to *send* the
token before the server *requires* it — an unset `server.auth_token` ignores
the header. Once all clients are sending, set `server.auth_token`
(e.g. `auth_token: ${MNEMO_AUTH_TOKEN}`) and restart. Rollback is a one-line
config removal plus restart.

## v3.1.2 (2026-05-28) — hardening: batch/live breaker isolation, body-size guard, requirements pin

Three hardening fixes surfaced by a security review.

**1. Batch writes no longer share the live embedding circuit breaker.**
The nightly dreamer (`mnemo-dream.py`) POSTs its synthesized memory to
`/writeback`, which embedded through the same `ResilientEmbedding.embed()`
— and the same `CircuitBreaker` — that guards the live `/context` read
path. A large or failing batch could trip the breaker (poisoning live
reads for the cooldown window) or be blocked by an already-open one. This
is the exact batch-vs-live breaker-sharing failure we hit once before.
- `ResilientEmbedding.embed()` gains a keyword-only `use_breaker: bool = True`.
  When `False`, it runs the same primary→fallback adaptive chain but never
  consults or mutates the breaker, and never perturbs the provider-health
  flags reported by `/health`.
- `WritebackRequest` gains a `batch: bool = False` field; the `/writeback`
  handler embeds with `use_breaker=not req.batch`.
- The dreamer now sends `batch: true`.

**2. Request body-size guard (DoS).** Added `ServerConfig.max_body_bytes`
(default 16 MiB, `0` disables) and a middleware that rejects oversized
payloads with `413` before they get embedded, indexed, or written to disk.
No legitimate memory write approaches the limit.

**3. `requirements.txt` realigned to `pyproject.toml`.** The stale file
listed `fastapi>=0.104.0` (no `!=0.136.3` exclusion — would resolve to the
MAL-2026-4750 release) and omitted the `sqlite-vec` runtime dep entirely.
Now mirrors `pyproject` with the security pins; `pyproject` remains canonical.

## v3.1.1 (2026-05-25) — Starlette 1.0 refactor + PYSEC-2026-161 pin

**The problem.** PYSEC-2026-161 (Host-header bypass in Starlette < 1.0.1)
shipped with no 0.x backport — the only fix is moving to the 1.x line.
Until now Starlette was a transitive dep through FastAPI with no floor
constraint, so the server could resolve to a vulnerable version. Real-world
exposure is bounded (both deploys are Tailscale-private or localhost), but
the deprecated lifecycle APIs that Starlette 1.x flags would eventually
break us anyway.

**What changed:**
- `pyproject.toml`: added explicit `starlette>=1.0.1` dependency. Closes
  the resolver gap where the security pin could be bypassed by anything
  installed alongside.
- `agentb/server.py`: migrated `@app.on_event("startup")` (deprecated in
  Starlette 1.x, removed in a future release) to the FastAPI lifespan
  asynccontextmanager pattern. The startup banner and the
  `maintenance_loop()` task launcher moved into the new `lifespan()`
  closure inside `create_app()`. The conditional `@app.middleware("http")`
  auth decorator was left untouched — it still works under Starlette 1.1.0
  without warnings. CORS middleware likewise stays on `app.add_middleware`.

**Verified before deploy.** Throwaway venv with `starlette==1.1.0`,
`fastapi==0.135.1`: `create_app()` returns clean under
`-W error::DeprecationWarning`, lifespan fires the banner on TestClient
startup, `/health` returns 200, and all 106 existing tests pass.

No HTTP API or MCP tool signatures changed. The `/health` endpoint now
reports `"version": "3.1.1"`.

## v3.1.0 (2026-05-23) — Mem0 bridge retired

The optional Mem0 cloud-deep fallback path has been removed. Mnemo Cortex
is now local-first only — no cloud memory fallback. This was an opt-in
feature off by default since the bridge shipped; no deployment had it
enabled in production. Removed code paths are preserved in git history
and the bridge module is retained at `agentb/mem0_bridge.py.retired-20260523`
per the archive-don't-delete doctrine.

**Why:** Mnemo's local performance (sub-100ms recall, 80% compaction
ratio, cross-agent dreaming) made the comparison race unnecessary. The
"and Mem0, not instead of Mem0" framing no longer matches the project's
direction.

**What changed:**
- `agentb/server.py`: removed conditional `from agentb.mem0_bridge import Mem0Bridge` block and the two MEM0 retrieval/write blocks in `/context` and `/writeback` endpoints. `cache_hits["MEM0"]` no longer appears in `/context` responses.
- `agentb/config.py`: removed `Mem0Config` dataclass, `AgentConfig.mem0_user_id` + `.mem0_fallback_only` fields, `AgentBConfig.mem0` field, `resolve_mem0()` function, and the corresponding load-time mappings. Any `mem0:` block in `~/.agentb/config.json` is now silently ignored.
- `agentb/mem0_bridge.py`: renamed to `agentb/mem0_bridge.py.retired-20260523`.
- `mnemo-dream.py`: log message updated from "L2 + Mem0" to "L2" to reflect single-target writeback.
- `README.md`, `llms.txt`: removed "Works with Mem0" section, Mem0 Bridge feature row, and `└── Mem0 Bridge` line from architecture diagram. Inspirations section keeps the Mem0 acknowledgment as historical credit. Competitor-comparison statements (Mem0/Zep/Letta) stay.

No HTTP API or MCP tool signatures changed. Existing clients see identical
request/response shapes minus the optional `cache_hits["MEM0"]` key.

## v3.0.0 (2026-05-21) — Version rebrand: v2.12.0 → v3.0.0

No code changes. This release re-tags what shipped as `v2.12.0` (Phase 3
Facts + Confidence, embedding hosted fallback, Dreamer rehab) as `v3.0.0`
to align with the public announcement.

The server app version (formerly tracked independently as `0.8.0`) is
unified with the package version starting here — both are now `3.0.0`.
README header and health-output examples updated to match.

See the v2.12.0 entry below for the full feature set in this release.

## v2.12.0 (2026-05-20) — Phase 3 Facts + Confidence, Embedding hosted fallback, Dreamer rehab

Three meaningful additions in one release. Server app version bumps from
`0.7.0` to `0.8.0`.

### Phase 3 — Structured Facts Table + Three-State Confidence

**The gap this closes.** Mnemo today treats every memory as text+tags
retrieved by FTS5 or vector similarity. That's the right tool for "what
did we decide about X" — fuzzy recall over prose. It's the wrong tool
for "what is the agent's location?" That's a key-value lookup
pretending to be a search. The Peter Widget name-recall failure was the
canonical case: a structured fact lookup got routed through semantic
search and returned wrong answers because the stored words didn't
overlap the query.

Facts also need confidence. Today a verified-from-source claim and a
hallucinated guess look identical in storage. When recall returns hits,
callers can't tell which are solid. Discord-architecture flip-flops
(three contradictory claims, all stated with equal confidence) become
invisible.

**What ships.**

- New SQLite store at `~/.agentb/facts.sqlite` (shared global, WAL mode).
  Two tables: `facts` (composite PK `(entity, attribute)`, one current
  value per pair) and `fact_history` (append-only audit log of every
  change). Schema auto-creates on connect — `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
  on every connection so the file can be deleted/recreated without a
  service restart.
- Three-state confidence: `verified > high_probability > false`.
  Promotion ladder enforced — `verified` only overwritten by another
  `verified` (with audit trail), lower confidence rejected if existing
  is higher.
- Six new HTTP routes: `GET /facts/{entity}/{attribute}`,
  `GET /facts?entity=&attribute=&value_contains=&confidence=`,
  `POST /facts`, `POST /facts/demote`,
  `GET /facts/history/{entity}/{attribute}`, `GET /facts/contradictions`.
- Four new MCP bridge tools: `mnemo_fact_get`, `mnemo_fact_query`,
  `mnemo_fact_save`, `mnemo_fact_demote`. The demote tool exists because
  the promotion ladder otherwise blocks `verified → false` transitions
  when the correct replacement value isn't yet known.
- Evidence source uses a prefix convention for pseudo-structure without
  schema enforcement: `memory:<id>`, `commit:<sha>`,
  `file:<path>:<line>`, `statement:<who>`, `bus:#<id>`, `dream:<date>`,
  `contradicted_by:<source>`.

**Dreamer Stage 0.5 — automated fact extraction.** Nightly Dreamer gains
a stage between harvest and synthesis that calls the LLM with a strict
conservative-only-direct-statements prompt to extract `(entity, attribute,
value)` triples and POST them to `/facts` with
`confidence='high_probability'`. Auto-capture entries (bridge captureCall
flushes, JSONL sync messages) are filtered before extraction — they're
tool-call logs, not stated facts. Conservative extraction is load-bearing
(not a tuning knob); loosening to inferred relationships is a deliberate
later decision driven by measured false-positive data.

**Contradiction notification.** When Stage 0.5 extracts a fact that
conflicts with an existing `verified` fact, the spec's promotion ladder
correctly rejects the overwrite — but silent rejection means
contradictions pile up and nobody reviews them. v2.12.0 batches all
per-run verified-vs-extracted conflicts and posts at end of Dreamer run
to two optional channels (both opt-in via env vars, both gracefully skip
when unset):

- Bus message via HTTP to a busmaster/dispatcher of your choice.
  Requires `MNEMO_DREAM_BUS_URL` + `MNEMO_DREAM_BUS_FROM` (registered
  sender agent name) + `MNEMO_DREAM_BUS_TARGETS` (comma-separated
  registered receivers). Envelope shape matches the
  `github.com/GuyMannDude/disco-bus` mesh spec.
- Discord webhook via `MNEMO_DREAM_DISCORD_WEBHOOK`. Direct human
  visibility without waiting for an agent to surface.

One batched message per cron run, never per-contradiction. Quiet nights
produce no notification.

**Cost.** Stage 0.5 adds one LLM call per agent per night to the
Dreamer pipeline. Per-night dream cost roughly doubles from $0.0013 to
$0.003 — still rounding error.

**Tests.** 23 new unit tests in `tests/test_facts_store.py` covering
happy paths, normalization, all promotion-ladder branches, demotion
edge cases, query filters, and persistence.

### Embedding hosted fallback

`agentb/providers.py:GoogleEmbedding.embed()` now reads
`self.config.extra.output_dimensionality` and passes it through. This
enables a fully working hosted fallback for the local Ollama embedding
primary: Google's `gemini-embedding-001` outputs 3072 dims natively but
supports Matryoshka truncation. Configure the fallback with
`extra.output_dimensionality: 768` to match the locked sqlite-vec store
width without dim-guard trips. See `agentb.yaml.example` for the full
shape. Closes the "if Ollama dies, every Mnemo recall 500s" gap flagged
in v2.11.5 task notes.

### Dreamer pipeline rehab

`mnemo-dream.py` had been silently dark since 2026-05-13 due to three
cascading failure modes — token explosion (4000+ accumulated memories
sent to gemini-2.5-flash as one prompt = ~6M tokens, model caps at 1M);
env file gap during the v2.10.0 cutover; and a path mismatch where the
script read from `~/.agentb/memory/<agent>/` (pre-cutover layout) but
memories had moved to `~/.agentb/agents/<agent>/memory/` (current
layout). v2.12.0 fixes all three:

- Path migration: harvest walks the current `~/.agentb/agents/<agent>/memory/`
  layout. Agent auto-discovery enumerates the directory at runtime;
  `MNEMO_DREAM_AGENTS` env var pins a specific list for installs that
  want explicit control.
- Two-stage map-reduce synthesis: per-agent partial summary first
  (cheap), then joint cross-agent rollup of summaries (also cheap).
  Per-call token usage is bounded; the 1M-context limit is never
  approached regardless of corpus size.

### Other

- `mnemo-cortex 0.8.0` server app version (was 0.7.0).
- Agent list in `MNEMO_DREAM_AGENTS` and bus envelope `MNEMO_DREAM_BUS_FROM`/
  `MNEMO_DREAM_BUS_TARGETS` are explicit env vars rather than hardcoded.

## v2.11.5 (2026-05-19) — Adaptive truncation on live recall (input-too-long != provider down)

**Problem.** Opie reported intermittent 503s from `mnemo_recall` / `mnemo_search`
on cross-agent search: `Embedding unavailable: All embedding providers failed
(primary + all fallbacks)`. Writes succeeded; only recall flapped. He
suspected Ollama was crashing or overloaded.

Diagnostics on artforge ruled that out — Ollama healthy (up 1d10h, peak 1GB,
GPU idle), nomic-embed-text loaded and responding instantly. The smoking gun
was in `journalctl -u ollama`: a rapid-fire burst of HTTP 400s clustered at
Opie's exact session time, with reason `llm embedding error: the input
length exceeds the context length`. Same class of bug v2.11.3 fixed for
the backfill path — but the live recall path had no equivalent shield.

**Root cause.** `ResilientEmbedding.embed()` (`agentb/providers.py`) treated
a 400 (input too long) the same as a 503 (provider down):

1. Primary 400s on oversized input.
2. Wrapper records a circuit-breaker failure (wrong — provider is fine).
3. Walks the fallback chain. Each fallback receives the same oversized
   input and also 400s with the same length error.
4. Final: `RuntimeError("All embedding providers failed")`, which the
   `/context` endpoint surfaces as a 503 to the caller.

The wrapper conflated input-property errors with provider-state errors.
v2.11.3's `embed_with_adaptive_truncation` solved this for backfill at the
call-site level; v2.11.5 lifts the same idea into the resilient wrapper so
all 8 `embedder.embed()` call sites in `server.py` (`/context`, `/preflight`,
`/writeback`, persona archive, etc.) get the fix for free.

**Fix.** `agentb/providers.py`:

- New `ResilientEmbedding._try_embed_adaptive(provider, text)`: invokes one
  provider, halves the input on HTTP 400 down to a 500-char floor, retries
  on the same provider. Re-raises anything that isn't a 400, or a 400 below
  the floor.
- `ResilientEmbedding.embed(text)` now calls `_try_embed_adaptive` for the
  primary and for each fallback. Halving stays on a single provider (it's
  an input issue, not a provider issue) and **does not record a circuit-
  breaker failure** for input-too-long. Real provider failures (503, timeout,
  connection refused, etc.) still failover and still trip the breaker.

**Why it lives in the wrapper, not at each call site:** every server-side
embed path benefits without per-site changes, and the wrapper is the
correct place to decide "is this a property of the input or a property of
the provider." Putting the logic at call sites would have meant patching 8
places and remembering to patch the 9th.

**Tests** (`tests/test_agentb.py::TestResilientEmbedding`):

- `test_400_halves_and_succeeds_on_primary` — primary 400s once, halves,
  succeeds. No failover.
- `test_400_does_not_trip_circuit_breaker` — three 400-then-recover cycles
  do not open the breaker.
- `test_400_at_min_chars_falls_over_to_fallback` — primary 400s even at
  the floor, fallback handles it.
- `test_non_400_error_is_provider_failure` — a 503 on primary fails over
  immediately (one call, no halving).

All 6 ResilientEmbedding tests green; 95/96 in the full agentb suite (the
one failure is in `tests/passport/test_validation.py`, pre-existing,
unrelated to the embedder).

**Deploy.** Pull on artforge's `mnemo-cortex-stage` (same branch); restart
`mnemo-cortex.service`. The bridge on each agent is unaffected.

## v2.11.4 (2026-05-19) — Session IDs in host-local time, not UTC

**Problem.** Session IDs were generated with `new Date().toISOString()` and
the date prefix was stamped from that UTC string. Every other timestamp the
agents write — `active.md` dates, brain commit messages, kickstart filenames
— uses host-local time (America/Los_Angeles for IGOR + artforge). The
session ID was the sole exception. After 17:00 PT the UTC date has already
rolled to "tomorrow," producing IDs like `opie-2026-05-20-00-22-53` while
the rest of the brain still says `2026-05-19`. Opie spotted the drift mid-
session.

**Fix.** `integrations/mcp-bridge/server.js` — added `localTimestamp()` and
`localDateOnly()` helpers near the `sessionId` declaration; replaced all
four UTC-derived call sites:

- Line ~640 — `mnemo_save` session_id fallback
- Line ~741 — session bootstrap (the primary site)
- Line ~1098 — `session_end` session_id fallback
- Line ~1129 — brain commit message date

Format unchanged (`YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS`), so existing consumers treat new
IDs identically to old ones. Old IDs in the Mnemo store stay as-is; this
is a forward-only correction.

**Deploy.** Every agent picks up the fix on its next restart of the bridge
process: CC at next `claude` session start, Opie at next full Claude Desktop
quit + relaunch, Rocky at next `hermes` launch, nurse on artforge after
`systemctl --user restart` of its bridge unit. No artforge-side mnemo
service changes — this is bridge-local.

## v2.11.3 (2026-05-16) — Adaptive truncation + circuit-breaker bypass on backfill

Two more failure modes surfaced during the artforge deploy of v2.11.0–2:

1. **Static caps don't fit token-dense content.** v2.11.1 capped backfill
   input at 6000 chars; v2.11.2 dropped that to 4000 after 6000 still 400'd
   on opie's path-heavy wiki FILE INDEX batches. Even 4000 fails on some
   entries (long UUID-laden URIs tokenize at ~1 char/token). 3000 worked on
   the worst observed cases. But a constant cap will always be wrong for
   *some* content — the right answer is adaptive retry.

2. **Backfill shared the embedder's circuit breaker with live `/context`
   queries.** When three consecutive 400s tripped the breaker mid-backfill,
   every subsequent embed call — including for live recall — was skipped
   instantly until the 60s cooldown elapsed. Backfill was poisoning the
   service it was meant to upgrade.

This release fixes both:

- **`agentb/vec.py`** — `embed_with_adaptive_truncation()` catches HTTP 400
  from the embed call and retries with input halved (down to a 500-char
  floor). Returns the vector AND the text that was actually embedded so
  `vec_sources.text` stays consistent with the vector. Backfill uses it by
  default (`adaptive=True`); tests can flip it off when using synthetic
  embedders that don't raise httpx errors.
- **`agentb/server.py`** — `/vec/backfill` now passes `embedder.primary.embed`
  rather than the resilient wrapper. Per-entry failures stay per-entry; the
  shared circuit breaker is never touched by backfill, so a long batch over
  heterogeneous content can no longer poison live recall.
- **`agentb/vec.py`** — backfill stats now include a `truncated` counter so
  the response and logs report how many entries needed adaptive halving.
- **`tests/test_vec.py`** — four new tests cover the halving behavior, the
  500-char min-floor giveup, propagation of non-400 errors, and the
  truncated-counter accounting through `backfill()`.

**Production result.** After this release the artforge opie tenant backfills
cleanly — adaptive truncation eats the dense entries, no circuit breaker
flips, live queries unaffected.


## v2.11.2 (2026-05-16) — Drop backfill input cap to 4000 chars (superseded)

Follow-up to v2.11.1. The 6000-char cap still 400'd on production data:
opie's wiki FILE INDEX BATCH entries are path-heavy (long file URIs +
UUIDs + hashes), and that content tokenizes much denser than typical
English prose. A 6000-char input produced more tokens than nomic-embed
-text's 2048-token window could hold, so the same circuit-breaker
cascade re-occurred. Direct test confirmed 4000 chars succeeds where
6000 fails on the same entries. Dropping the cap to 4000.

Superseded same day by v2.11.3, which moved from "pick the right constant"
to "adapt per entry" and isolated the failure surface from live queries.


## v2.11.1 (2026-05-16) — Backfill survives oversize memory entries

Discovered during the artforge deploy of v2.11.0. The `opie` tenant has
auto-generated "FILE INDEX BATCH" memories — wiki-ingest output with 30
file paths per entry, several thousand to seventeen thousand characters
of text. nomic-embed-text accepts ~2048 tokens and returns HTTP 400 on
anything past that. Five consecutive 400s trip the embedder's circuit
breaker, and the rest of the backfill (2663 of 2666 entries for opie)
fails instantly without an embedding even being attempted.

This patch caps `iter_memory_entries`' text output at
`MAX_EMBED_INPUT_CHARS = 6000` (a safe margin under nomic's actual
context length) and emits a per-entry warning when truncation happens.
The truncated text is what gets stored in `vec_sources.text` so the
source row stays consistent with the vector. The lost tail of a 17 k
character file-index batch is mostly redundant path prefixes — a
6 k-char prefix retains enough signal for semantic recall.

This is a backfill-side fix. `/writeback` already wraps its embed call
in a try/except that downgrades to a warning, so live writes degrade
gracefully on oversize input rather than 5xx'ing the caller. A future
release will lift truncation into the embedding provider so writeback
and backfill share the same cap.

**Production result.** Re-ran the artforge backfill: rocky 168/168,
cc 1411/1411, opie 2666/2666. All three tenants now have a complete
vec index. Total Ollama wall time across all three agents ~5 minutes.

- `agentb/vec.py` — `MAX_EMBED_INPUT_CHARS` constant + truncation in
  `iter_memory_entries` with per-entry warning log.
- `tests/test_vec.py` — `test_iter_memory_entries_truncates_oversize`
  asserts the cap is applied and the warning fires.


## v2.11.0 (2026-05-16) — sqlite-vec vector index (Mnemo v4 Phase 2)

Before this release, vector recall was a linear scan. Every `/context`
call read every memory bundle from disk, computed cosine similarity in
Python, and ranked the result. At 1,398 production memories the L1/L2/L3
chain works; at 14,000 it doesn't. The index needed to live next to the
memories, not be rebuilt from JSON on every read.

This release adds an indexed sqlite-vec table per agent. The existing
L1 (project precache) and L2/L3 (linear scans) tiers stay — the new VEC
tier slots between them and answers semantic recall in milliseconds even
on the full corpus.

**What's new in `agentb/`.**

- **`agentb/vec.py`** — new module. `VecStore` wraps a per-tenant SQLite
  file with two tables: `vec_sources(memory_id, text, source_file, created_at)`
  and `vec_embeddings USING vec0(memory_id, embedding FLOAT[768])`. Source
  text and vectors are stored separately so the embedding index is
  rebuildable without touching memory bundles (Open Brain's
  source/vector separation principle). Dimension is locked to 768 —
  matched to `nomic-embed-text`, the default primary embedder. A vector
  of the wrong dimension raises `VecDimMismatch` and refuses the write
  rather than silently dropping data; loud failure beats silent vector
  loss (Vapor Truth doctrine).
- **`agentb/vec.py`** — auto-detected operating modes. `detect_mode(memory_dir)`
  returns `migration` when JSON entries already live on disk and `clean`
  otherwise. Existing installs upgrade in place: their bundles stay as
  the source of truth and a one-shot backfill populates the vec index.
  Fresh installs initialize empty. The user never picks a mode.
- **`agentb/vec.py`** — `backfill(store, memory_dir, embed)` walks the
  memory directory, re-embeds canonical `summary + key_facts` text per
  bundle, and upserts into the vec index. Idempotent (skips already-indexed
  ids) and tolerant (continues past per-entry embedding failures and
  malformed files). Returns counters for `total / embedded / skipped /
  failed / elapsed_sec`.
- **`agentb/server.py`** — `TenantManager` now constructs a `VecStore` at
  `<data_dir>/vec_index.sqlite` for every agent and records the detected
  mode. `/writeback` reuses the embedding it already computed for the L2
  tier and upserts it into the vec index in the same transaction. The
  `/context` pipeline gains a VEC tier between L1 and L2 — when the vec
  index has data, the query embedding runs against vec0's k-NN, hits are
  wrapped as `ContextChunk(cache_tier="VEC")`, and `cache_hits["VEC"]`
  surfaces in the response. L2/L3 still run when VEC doesn't return
  enough chunks; nothing else in the chain changed.
- **`agentb/server.py`** — `GET /vec/status?agent_id=X` reports mode,
  indexed count, on-disk memory count, and db path for the tenant.
  `POST /vec/backfill?agent_id=X` runs the backfill walk on demand and
  returns the stats dict. Use this once on upgrade for existing installs;
  dreaming can call it nightly for ongoing maintenance.
- **`pyproject.toml`** — adds `sqlite-vec>=0.1.6` as a runtime dependency.
- **`tests/test_vec.py`** — new test module. Sixteen tests cover store
  init, upsert/replace/delete, dimension-guard rejection (write and
  query paths), mode detection across empty / json-present / missing
  directories, `iter_memory_entries` (canonical text shape, empties
  skipped, corrupt files tolerated), backfill (single-pass, idempotent,
  failure-tolerant), and the spec's canonical semantic-over-keyword
  scenario.

**Verified on the production corpus.** Backfilled 1,398 cc-agent memory
bundles in 86.5s (~62 ms/entry, Ollama-bound) and observed vec0 k-NN
queries returning top-3 in 3–4 ms over the full set. The same query
shape against the legacy linear-scan path touches every bundle on every
call.

**Upgrade path.** `pip install --upgrade mnemo-cortex`, restart, then
`POST /vec/backfill?agent_id=<your-agent>` once. The vec index appears
alongside `memory/` inside each agent data directory. Memory bundles
stay where they are. Nothing else changes for the user.


## v2.10.0 (2026-05-16) — Provenance & decay land in the open-source core

The MCP bridge announced provenance & decay support back in v2.8.0, but
the Python core that stores memories never received the matching code.
Internal deployments ran a hand-maintained fork while the published
package shipped a pre-provenance backend. Bridge sent the fields, the
backend ignored them.

This release closes that gap. One source of truth.

**What's new in `agentb/`.**

- **`agentb/provenance.py`** — new module. `VALID_SOURCES`,
  `VALID_CATEGORIES`, `DECAY_THRESHOLDS`, `DEFAULT_HIDDEN_CATEGORIES`, the
  regex `PROVENANCE_PATTERNS`, `suggest_category(text)`, and
  `compute_stale_warning(category, created_at)`.
- **`agentb/server.py`** — `WritebackRequest` adopts `source`, `category`,
  `additional_tags`. `WritebackResponse` returns `category_used`,
  `category_suggested`, `category_match_keywords`, `source_used`.
  `ContextRequest` adopts `source`, `category`, `exclude_categories`,
  `exclude_stale`, `max_age_days` filters. `ContextChunkResponse` surfaces
  `provenance_source`, `category`, `additional_tags`, `age_days`,
  `stale_warning`. Writeback runs the regex auto-suggester when no
  category is given and persists `schema_version: 3` on every record.
  `keep_chunk()` applies the filter set across HOT/L1/L2/L3 with 3× over-
  fetch so post-filter trims don't leave callers short. `session_log` is
  hidden by default — pass `exclude_categories=[]` to disable.
- **`agentb/cache.py`** — `ContextChunk` gains optional v3 fields. `L2`
  search reads `metadata.provenance_source` / `metadata.category` /
  `metadata.additional_tags` and computes `age_days` + `stale_warning` per
  chunk. `l3_scan()` does the same straight off the memory_entry record.
- **`agentb/config.py`** — `AgentConfig` adds `mem0_user_id` and
  `mem0_fallback_only` overrides. New `resolve_mem0(cfg, agent_id)` helper
  routes per-agent Mem0 traffic. Two common shapes — agents sharing a
  Mem0 user namespace, or each agent owning its own — both expressible
  in `agentb.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  agents:
    primary-agent:
      mem0_user_id: primary
      mem0_fallback_only: false   # always query Mem0 alongside local
    secondary-agent:
      mem0_user_id: shared        # writes/reads against the same Mem0 user
      mem0_fallback_only: true    # only hit Mem0 when local misses
    tertiary-agent:
      mem0_user_id: shared
      mem0_fallback_only: true
  ```

**Backward compatibility.** Old records (no v3 fields on disk) load
without issue — `keep_chunk` treats unset fields as "pass" when no filter
is active. Old callers that don't pass v3 params on writeback get
`source: inferred` + the auto-suggested category. The on-disk field name
`provenance_source` in L2 metadata stays as it is — no migration script
needed. Strict source filter (`source=user`) drops pre-v3 chunks on
purpose: they have no provenance to evaluate.

**Decay thresholds (days).** Topology warns at 30, stale at 90.
current_state and unknown warn at 90. Relationship warns at 180.
session_log warns at 90. Doctrine, incident, identity, decision are
perpetual — never stale. Override via env: `MNEMO_DECAY_TOPOLOGY_WARN_DAYS`,
`MNEMO_DECAY_RELATIONSHIP_WARN_DAYS`, etc.

**FastAPI app version** bumps to `0.7.0` (`agentb/server.py`); package
version (`pyproject.toml`) bumps to `2.10.0` to match.

**`mnemo_v2/` retired.** The repo previously carried a parallel
conversation-archive product under `mnemo_v2/` — SQLite + FTS5 over
message transcripts with leaf/condensed summary compaction. It never
shared callers with the memory engine in `agentb/`: nothing imported
from it, `install.sh` didn't deploy it, the MCP bridge didn't route to
it, and `tests/test_smoke.py` was its only consumer. Two parallel
servers under one repo confused readers about which path was "the"
backend. Removed (`mnemo_v2/`, `tests/test_smoke.py`, the deprecated
`integrations/claude-code/mnemo-watcher-cc.sh` shim that targeted it,
plus the `pyproject.toml` and `scripts/wheel-smoke-test.sh` references).
If conversation compaction is wanted in the future, building it on
`agentb/` directly is simpler than maintaining a parallel server.

## v2.9.0 (2026-05-15) — Developer Dump (Mnemo v4 Phase 1)

First piece of the Mnemo v4 roadmap. Adds bridge-level JSONL capture of
every MCP tool call across all agents that route through the shared MCP
bridge (CC, Opie, Rocky, Hermes, Claude Desktop, anything else). Default
**off** — no surprise data collection for public users. Flip on with one
env var.

**Problem this solves.** When a tool call silently fails (Peter Widget
went dark for hours and nobody noticed), there's no trace to look at. The
bridge knew every detail of what happened — tool name, params, response,
latency, success/failure — and threw it all away. Same loss when you want
training data, a debugging trail, or to understand why an agent
flip-flopped three times on the same answer.

**What ships.** A new `dump.js` module in the MCP bridge that wraps every
tool handler with a writer. One monkey-patch on `server.registerTool`
covers all 18 existing tools and any future additions. Output is JSONL,
one file per agent per day, human-greppable with `jq`:

```bash
# Turn it on for your bridge
export MNEMO_DUMP=on
# (optional) custom dir, default ~/.mnemo-cortex/dumps
export MNEMO_DUMP_DIR=~/dumps
```

```jsonl
{"ts":"2026-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","kind":"header","schema_version":1,"mnemo_version":"2.9.0","agent_id":"rocky"}
{"schema_version":1,"ts":"2026-05-15T20:14:33.123Z","kind":"tool_call","agent_id":"rocky","tool":"mnemo_save","params":{...},"response":{...},"latency_ms":47,"ok":true}
{"schema_version":1,"ts":"...","kind":"tool_call","agent_id":"rocky","tool":"mnemo_recall","params":{...},"response":null,"latency_ms":12,"ok":false,"error":"ECONNREFUSED"}
```

**Failure capture.** Handlers in the bridge catch internally and return
`{isError: true}` instead of throwing — the dump still records those as
`ok: false` with the error message extracted from the response text. Real
thrown errors are also captured and then re-thrown unchanged.

**Fail-loud on write errors.** If the dump directory becomes unwritable
(disk full, permission flip), the writer logs `[MNEMO DUMP FAIL]` to
stderr once per failure streak. Tool dispatch keeps working — the dump
never breaks the bridge.

**CLI for inspection** (server-side, via `mnemo-cortex`):

```bash
mnemo-cortex dump list                  # all dump files, size + line count
mnemo-cortex dump tail rocky            # live-tail today's rocky dump
mnemo-cortex dump tail rocky --no-follow # one-shot print
```

**Zero overhead when off.** `dump.wrap()` returns the original handler
unchanged when `MNEMO_DUMP=off` (the default). No allocation, no closure,
no measurable cost.

**Schema versioning.** Every line carries `schema_version: 1`. Future
Phase 1.5+ additions (per-agent message capture, custom content filters)
will bump the schema cleanly.

**Tests:** 10 new tests in `dump.test.js`, all passing — covers off-mode
no-op, on-mode header+event, two-agent isolation, day rollover, write-
failure handling, success capture, isError capture, thrown-error capture,
disabled passthrough, and `listDumps()`. Runs without a Mnemo server.

**Scope discipline.** Phase 1 only captures what the bridge sees — MCP
tool traffic. Agent-side messages (user prompts, agent text responses,
raw Claude API exchanges) live in agent processes and need per-agent
hooks. That's the Phase 1.5 frontier. See
`brain/mnemo-v4-phase1-dump-spec.md` in `sparks-brain-guy` for the design
rationale; bus #223 for the pressure-tests that produced it.

Version alignment: this release also bumps `pyproject.toml` (was 2.7.1)
and the CLI `--version` string (was 2.6.4) to match the CHANGELOG /
bridge versions. They had drifted across the last few releases.

## v2.8.2 (2026-05-15) — Installer hardening (non-interactive + DRY_RUN fixes)

Two installers had bugs that silently broke `curl | bash` and CI workflows.
Found while auditing why a community user reported install trouble.

**Fix 1 — `integrations/hermes/install.sh` hung in non-interactive mode.**

Hermes Agent's `hermes mcp add` (v0.12.0+) prompts *after* tool discovery
with "Enable all N tools? [Y/n/select]". The installer didn't pipe a
response, so any non-TTY run (curl|bash, CI, dotfile bootstrap, restricted
shell) hung there forever — or, on some shells, silently dropped the
config persist step. The user saw "✓ Connected!" and then nothing.

Now: the installer detects `[ -t 0 ]` at startup. In non-interactive mode
it pipes `yes Y` into `hermes mcp add` to auto-accept tool selection,
and honors env vars in place of the interactive prompts:

```bash
MNEMO_URL=http://localhost:50001 \
MNEMO_AGENT_ID=hermes \
MNEMO_SHARE=separate \
MNEMO_REPLACE=1 \
bash install.sh < /dev/null
```

Replace-existing requires explicit `MNEMO_REPLACE=1` in non-interactive
mode rather than silently overwriting a working config. Unreachable
Mnemo aborts loudly instead of wiring Hermes to a dead server.

**Fix 2 — `robot-install.sh` DRY_RUN leaked API keys to disk.**

`MNEMO_INSTALL_DRY_RUN=1` was meant to skip side effects, but step 3
(config + env file + data dirs) was never gated. A user testing the
installer with their real `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` set in the environment
would silently have that key written into
`~/.config/mnemo-cortex/mnemo-cortex.env` (mode 0600). Dry-run with a
real key was a foot-cannon.

Now: step 3 is wrapped in the same `DRY_RUN` guard as steps 2/4/5.
Dry-run reports the paths each step *would* write but produces zero side
effects on disk. Verified with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=test-not-real
MNEMO_INSTALL_DRY_RUN=1 ./robot-install.sh` — no files created.

**Doc fixes alongside.** README clarifies that `robot.install` sets up
the **server only**; agent integrations live under `integrations/`.
Hermes integration README updated for the current 18-tool surface
(was 17 — `agent_startup` got added) and notes that the config entry
lands at `~/.hermes/profiles/<profile>/config.yaml` for profile-using
Hermes setups, not just `~/.hermes/config.yaml`.

## v2.8.1 (2026-05-13) — MCP bridge directory rename

`integrations/openclaw-mcp/` → `integrations/mcp-bridge/`. The bridge
code at the old path was never OpenClaw-specific — it's the generic
Node.js MCP server that every Mnemo Cortex integration (Claude Desktop,
Claude Code, OpenClaw, LM Studio, AnythingLLM, Agent Zero, Hermes Agent,
Ollama Desktop, etc.) spawns on stdio. The old directory name misled
new users; the new path tells the truth.

**Rename-only release. No functional change.** The 8 host-specific
integration directories all had their install scripts + config
examples + READMEs updated to point at the new path. Server.js +
package.json + CHANGELOG + tests moved with `git mv`.

**Back-compat:** the old path `integrations/openclaw-mcp/` is kept as
a thin stub — symlinks at `server.js` and `package.json` resolve to
the new location, plus a README explaining the move. Existing MCP
client configs pointing at the old path keep working without action;
update them at your convenience. Will be removed in a future major
version.

Full bridge release notes: [integrations/mcp-bridge/CHANGELOG.md](integrations/mcp-bridge/CHANGELOG.md)

## v2.7.1 (2026-05-04)

Public-release scrub. Mnemo Cortex was developed inside Project Sparks
against a specific multi-agent setup (CC, Rocky, Opie, BW, Cliff, Sparky,
Alice). The source carried that history in defaults, examples, system
prompts, and test fixtures. This release strips the customer/operator/agent
specifics so a fresh user gets a stock/default toolbox they can configure
for their own stack.

### Bridge (integrations/openclaw-mcp, 2.7.0 → 2.7.1)

- **`opie_startup` alias neutralized.** Was hardcoded with a multi-paragraph
  Opie-flavored identity prompt naming a specific operator, machine, and
  team. Now returns a minimal "you ran the deprecated alias, your identity
  lives in opie.md" header. Identity belongs in the brain lane file, not
  in bridge code. The alias still loads opie.md and forces agent_id=opie
  for back-compat — only the static identity block changed.
- **Tool descriptions made generic.** "Sparks Brain directory" → "brain
  directory ($BRAIN_DIR)". `write_brain_file` description no longer names
  specific lane files.

### Synthesis scripts

- **`mnemo-dream.py`**: agent list is now auto-discovered from
  `~/.agentb/memory/<agent>/` subdirectories at runtime. Override with
  `MNEMO_DREAM_AGENTS` env var (comma-separated). System prompt rewritten
  to be agent-agnostic — describes "a multi-agent workspace" without
  naming specific agents or their roles. The agents declare their roles
  through the memories themselves; the synthesizer reads them.
- **`mnemo-wiki-compile.py`**: agent aliases now load from
  `MNEMO_WIKI_AGENT_ALIASES` env var (JSON). Was a hardcoded map of
  Sparks-internal agent names. Discord token / channels paths default to
  `~/.mnemo-cortex/` (was `~/.sparks/`).

### Docs / examples

- **THE-LANE-PROTOCOL.md** task-shape examples now use generic slugs
  (`auth-rate-limit`, `builder`, `architect`) instead of project-specific
  ones (`hoffman-gmc-appeal`, named-agent assignees).
- **`integrations/hermes/README.md`** cross-agent example uses a generic
  "build agent" / "deploy issue" instead of a specific customer/incident.
- **`integrations/openclaw-mcp/README.md`** `MNEMO_AGENT_ID` examples use
  role-shaped names (`assistant`, `builder`, `researcher`).
- **`agentb/recall/parser.py`** docstring example bullets now use
  `@user` / `@builder` instead of named operator/agent.
- **README.md** Origin Story tightened — narrative pointer to
  `FINDING-MNEMO.md` for the full backstory; Credits section keeps the
  contributor list as project history but drops internal-infra
  references.
- **`tests/ongoing/daily-feed.sh`** synthetic test data fully rewritten —
  fictional company, generic agent roles, no real names, locations, or
  customers. The test-questions schema is preserved; only the content
  changed. Stale `tests/ongoing/test-questions.json` removed (the
  generator regenerates it on next run).

### Sparks Bus example agent cards

- Old cards (`bw.json`, `cc.json`, `cliff.json`, `opie.json`, `rocky.json`)
  named specific Sparks-internal agents and infrastructure (Tailscale
  hostnames, internal Discord channels). Replaced with three generic
  cards (`researcher.json`, `builder.json`, `architect.json`) — one per
  delivery method (Discord channel, subprocess, queue/pull). Same A2A
  shape, same Sparks-Bus delivery block format, no real identifiers.
- `sparks_bus/A2A.md` table updated to match.

### Minor

- All `HTTP-Referer` headers in OpenRouter calls now point at the public
  GitHub repo URL instead of the maintainer's personal site.
- `passport/config.py` skeleton example uses `GreenLeaf` (fictional)
  instead of `Hoffman Bedding` (real customer name from origin context).

## v2.6.5 (2026-05-01)

Two install-blocking fixes found while wiring Hermes Agent against the public
package. Both were silent in 2.6.4 — the package installed, but
`mnemo-cortex start` crashed at import time, and even if it had started, the
`--port` flag was dead code.

- **ImportError on startup fixed.** `agentb/server.py` imported `Mem0Config`
  from `agentb.config`, but the class was never defined there and
  `agentb/mem0_bridge.py` was never committed. Result: any fresh
  `pip install mnemo-cortex && mnemo-cortex start` died with
  `ImportError: cannot import name 'Mem0Config' from 'agentb.config'`. The
  Mem0 dataclass + AgentBConfig field + YAML loader + `Mem0Bridge` class are
  now present in the repo. Mem0 is opt-in (`enabled: false` by default), so
  users who don't configure Mem0 simply never trigger the upstream code path.
- **`--port` flag now overrides config.** `mnemo-cortex start --port 50002`
  previously captured the value but never passed it to the server subprocess
  — the bind port came exclusively from `agentb.yaml`'s `server.port`. The
  CLI now exports `MNEMO_PORT` to the subprocess env, and `agentb/server.py`
  honors it as an override over `cfg.server.port`. The yaml stays
  authoritative when the flag is omitted.

No 2.6.4 CHANGELOG entry exists; it shipped as a version bump without a
release note. Anything that landed between 2.6.3 and 2.6.5 is in `git log`.

## v2.6.3 (2026-04-27)

Audit-driven catalog polish (Opie's compliance pass). Two real fixes plus
one nice-to-have, all narrowed from a line-by-line check of the v2.6.2
bundle against the MCPB spec + Connectors Directory submission requirements.

- **`tools_generated: true`** declared in the manifest. The bridge
  conditionally registers up to 8 additional tools at startup based on
  `BRAIN_DIR` / `WIKI_DIR` presence, so the manifest tool list isn't always
  exhaustive. This flag tells reviewers and hosts that's intentional.
- **`tools` array expanded to all 17** with explicit "Conditional (BRAIN_DIR)"
  / "Conditional (WIKI_DIR)" prefixes on the optional ones. Previously the
  manifest declared 9; a reviewer testing on a Sparks-style box would have
  seen 17 and flagged the mismatch.
- **`icons` array** added alongside the existing `icon` string for richer
  catalog rendering. Single 512×512 entry today; room for theme variants
  later without further schema changes.
- Bundle rebuilt; size unchanged (~3.6 MB packed).

No code changes in this release — manifest only, plus the version bump.

---

## v2.6.2 (2026-04-27)

Catalog-grade polish on the Claude Desktop bundle.

- All 17 tool registrations migrated from the deprecated `server.tool(...)`
  signature to `server.registerTool(...)` with proper `annotations`. Every
  tool now declares `title` plus `readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint` /
  `idempotentHint` / `openWorldHint` per the [MCP tool annotations spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/tools#tool-annotations).
  Hosts can now show a clear destructive-action warning before
  `write_brain_file`, `session_end`, and `passport_forget_or_override` fire.
- `manifest.json` declares `privacy_policies` pointing at `PRIVACY.md`.
- New top-level `PRIVACY.md` documents the data flow plainly: bundle talks
  only to the user-configured Mnemo Cortex URL, no telemetry, no third-party
  services unless the user's server is configured that way.
- Claude Desktop README adds a Privacy section.
- Bundle rebuilt with the updated bridge.

These changes meet the requirements for submission to Anthropic's curated
Connectors Directory ([docs](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/building/submission)).

---

## v2.6.1 (2026-04-27)

Bridge surfaces agent attribution again. Mnemo Cortex's `/context` endpoint
returns chunks without an `agent_id` field, so the bridge was always
displaying `agent=?` in cross-agent search results. Now the bridge infers
the agent from the `session:` source string (which is written as
`{AGENT_ID}-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS` since v2.5.0).

- `formatChunks` now derives a tag from `c.source` when `c.agent_id` is
  absent.
- Patterns covered: `session:cc-2026-...`, `session:lmstudio-igor2-2026-...`,
  `session:dream-2026-04-25`. `mem0:*` chunks tag as `mem0`. Anything else
  still falls through as `?`.
- Known limitation: the server-side `agent_id` filter on `/context` is a
  ranking hint, not a strict filter — passing `agent_id=cc` to artforge can
  still return non-cc chunks if they rank highly. That's a Mnemo Cortex
  server issue; the bridge can't fix it. For exact-match retrieval, use
  unique marker phrases in your save content.

---

## v2.6.0 (2026-04-27)

Tools auto-detected based on available directories. Fresh installs see 9
core memory tools.

- **Default tool surface = 9 tools** (4 memory + 5 Passport).
- **Brain-lane + session tools (5)** auto-enable when `BRAIN_DIR` exists
  (default `~/github/sparks-brain-guy/brain`).
- **Wiki tools (3)** auto-enable when `WIKI_DIR` exists (default `~/wiki`).
- No flags, no env-var switches — if the directory is on disk, the tools
  register; if not, they don't.

| Setup | Tools registered |
|---|---|
| Default | **9** — memory + Passport |
| + brain dir | 14 |
| + wiki dir | 12 |
| + both | 17 |

---

## v2.5.0 — "One Bridge" (2026-04-26)

The MCP bridge becomes a single drop-in for every agent. Restores the
brain-lane, wiki, and auto-capture tools that came over from the archived
`mnemo-cortex-mcp` repo, layered on top of the existing Passport + share
bridge. One bridge. Every agent. No more "which server.js do I point at?"

### What Changed

- **Restored 8 tools that were removed in v2.3.0** when Claude Desktop's
  storage architecture forced the integration pull. They're back in the
  unified bridge: `opie_startup`, `read_brain_file`, `list_brain_files`,
  `write_brain_file`, `session_end`, `wiki_search`, `wiki_read`, `wiki_index`.
  The Passport + `mnemo_share` tools introduced in v2.4.x are unchanged.
  Total: 17 tools.
- **Auto-capture + nudge system ported.** Tool calls are buffered (8 entries
  or 2 min idle) and flushed to Mnemo as background activity trail. After
  20 calls without a manual save, responses get a save reminder appended.
  `SIGTERM` / `SIGINT` drain the buffer before exit. Passport tools are
  marked `skip` — their audit lives in passport's git log already.
- **Session ID prefix honors `MNEMO_AGENT_ID`.** CC's saves get `cc-`
  prefix, Rocky's get `rocky-`, Opie's stay `opie-`. The previous bridge
  hardcoded `opie-` regardless of the env var. (The fix already existed
  in the openclaw-mcp bridge from v2.4 — it's now propagated through the
  ported tools too.)
- **`session_end` git commit message respects `AGENT_ID`.** Was hardcoded
  `"brain: Opie session end"`; now uses the running agent's id.
- **Single shared HTTP client.** All tools route through the `mnemoRequest`
  helper with 10s timeout + abort-on-stall. Replaces the legacy bridge's
  fire-and-hope `fetch` calls.
- **`BRAIN_DIR`, `WIKI_DIR`, `DREAM_DIR` env vars** for non-default install
  paths. Defaults still match the Sparks-Brain reference layout — but
  non-Sparks users can override.
- **Archived `mnemo-cortex-mcp` repo stays archived.** No further changes
  there. The legacy `server.js` was patched in-place earlier the same day
  for the agent-ID prefix bug — fix kept locally for any installs still
  pointing at that path; this release supersedes it.

### Migration

If you're still pointing at the legacy bridge (`mnemo-cortex-mcp/server.js`)
or the slim openclaw-mcp bridge (`mnemo-cortex/integrations/openclaw-mcp/server.js`
pre-v2.5.0):

1. Pull latest `mnemo-cortex`.
2. `cd integrations/openclaw-mcp && npm install`.
3. Update your MCP config command path to point at this `server.js`.
4. Restart whatever spawns the bridge (Claude Code session, OpenClaw gateway).

Tool names and behavior are unchanged — existing prompts and agent muscle
memory keep working.

---

## v2.4.1 — "Developer's Passport" (2026-04-22)

Passport gets an honest name and the tuning loop lands its first real pass.
This is a dev-targeted release: the product is aimed at developers building
agent systems who want a known-good pattern for safe behavioral-claim
ingestion. The possessive in the name is deliberate — it drops when the
hosted / browser-AI story is ready for normal users. Not today.

### What Changed

- **Rebrand: Passport → Developer's Passport** (product name only; code
  paths, tool names, YAML schema, and REST API all unchanged). `passport/`
  stays `passport/`. `passport_get_user_context` still `passport_get_user_context`.
- **Policy tweaks applied after corpus run.** Three policy changes approved
  and committed against the shipped 200-entry eval corpus:
  - `bucket_defaults.semi_trusted_remote`: `review_required` → `allow`
  - `bucket_defaults.untrusted_web`: `local_only` → `review_required`
  - `dispositions.insufficient_evidence`: new key, `review_required`
  `validation.py` now routes the <2-evidence short-circuit through the
  policy map instead of hard-coding `hard_block`, matching the pattern used
  for every other disposition.
- **Eval numbers published.** Overall moved from 48.0% / 0.428 macro-F1
  (baseline) to 53.0% / 0.458 (+5pp / +0.030) after the tweaks. Per-class
  F1: `allow` +0.251, `review_required` +0.089, `hard_block` +0.027,
  `local_only` -0.246. The `local_only` regression is inherent to raising
  the `untrusted_web` floor — those cases now land at `review_required`
  where a human can make the call. Detail in `passport/README.md`.
- **README rewritten for developers.** UNDER CONSTRUCTION banner removed.
  Accurate 5-tool table. 5-minute dev quickstart. Honest Known Gaps section
  (no Phase 2 classifier, no hosted HTTP MCP wrapper, no review UI, weak
  `local_only` F1, no per-user repo sync automation).
- **Chrome extension and claude.ai HTTP connector work parked** — neither
  was shipping in this release and neither was honest to advertise. When
  there's a live user for the browser path, that work resumes. Until then,
  the dev integration via stdio MCP (`integrations/openclaw-mcp/`) is the
  shipped path.
- **Eval corpus held separately.** The 200-entry labeled corpus used to
  produce the numbers above contains detector-bait tokens (fake-but-
  well-formed API keys) that trip public secret scanners. The harness
  (`tests/passport/corpus_score.py`) is in the repo; the corpus itself
  ships on request — open an issue for access.

### Why This Matters

The previous framing — "portable AI identity that travels with you to any
AI" — was writing a check the shipped code couldn't cash. The stdio MCP
integration works. The HTTP-to-claude.ai path doesn't exist yet. Renaming
to *Developer's* Passport aligns the pitch with what the product actually
delivers: a reference-grade safety + review-queue layer for devs who want
to wire it into their own agent stacks today.

### Models / Cost

No model changes. Validator is deterministic rule + detector logic; no LLM
calls in the hot path. Eval harness calls no LLM — it scores the current
validator against the labeled corpus.

---

## v2.4.0 — "Compile, Connect, Adapt" (2026-04-22)

The biggest release since v2.0. Three new feature surfaces land alongside the existing memory + dreaming core. Mnemo is now a full memory architecture, not just a memory store.

### What Changed

- **WikAI compiler** — `mnemo-wiki-compile.py` lands in the repo. Nightly cron at 3:30 AM (15 min after Dreaming) reads recent Mnemo memories, clusters by topic in Python (no LLM routing), then per-topic calls gemini-2.5-flash to rewrite the corresponding wiki page integrating new information. Cross-references are validated against the live page set — no hallucinated wikilinks. Every page carries a provenance footer listing source memory session IDs. Per-page failure isolation; one bad LLM call posts ⚠️ to `#alerts` and the run continues. Cost: ~$0.01–$0.05 per nightly. The wiki is never edited directly; Mnemo is the source of truth.
- **Sparks Bus** — agent-to-agent messaging with delivery confirmation, shipped as `sparks_bus/` inside this repo and standalone at github.com/GuyMannDude/sparks-bus. Doctrine: Discord = doorbell, Mnemo = mailbox, tracking ID = receipt. Lifecycle in `#dispatch`: 📬 DELIVERED → ✅ PICKED UP → 🔄 LOOP CLOSED. One-shot ⚠️ alerts on failure (no retry storms). Two install modes auto-detected: Full (with Mnemo) or Standalone (payload in Discord notification). A2A-compatible: Agent Cards in `sparks_bus/agent-cards/`, task-shape translator in the watcher, `A2A.md` mapping reference, `SETUP-PROMPT.md` for AI-bootstrapped deployments.
- **Passport** — portable user working-style preferences. Five MCP tools (`passport_observe_behavior`, `passport_list_pending_observations`, `passport_promote_observation`, `passport_forget_or_override`, `passport_get_user_context`). Observations become candidates, only stable claims promote — nothing auto-lands in the user's profile.
- **Three-layer architecture documented** — Mnemo (source of truth, query-time) + WikAI (compiled view, write-time) + Brain files (live state, ephemeral). When they disagree, Mnemo wins.
- **Inspirations credited openly** — Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern (WikAI), Nate B Jones's hybrid analysis (three-layer architecture), Google A2A (Sparks Bus compatibility), Mem0 (bridge not replace).
- **README + CAPABILITIES + landing page updated** — feature overview block, new sections, updated full-stack ASCII diagram.

### Why This Matters

Before v2.4, agents could remember (Mnemo), agents could share (Dreaming), and agents could fall back to depth (Mem0). After v2.4, agents can also:
- Read a *compiled* understanding of the project state without re-deriving from raw data on every query (WikAI)
- Send each other tracked, ack'd messages with the lifecycle visible to the operator in one Discord channel (Sparks Bus)
- Adapt their tone and workflow to how *this user* works (Passport)

The v2.4 release is when Mnemo became a memory architecture, not a memory server.

### Models / Cost

No model changes. WikAI compiler + Dreaming both run on `google/gemini-2.5-flash` via OpenRouter. Combined nightly cost: under $0.10.

## v2.3.2 — "Fresh Models" (2026-04-11)

Doc audit triggered by external user report: setup guide referenced dead Google model name (`text-embedding-004`, shut down Jan 2026), causing hours of debugging silent failures.

### What Changed

- **Model tier table updated** — Added Google cloud tier (`gemini-embedding-001` + `gemini-2.5-flash`), updated OpenAI reasoning model to `gpt-4.1-nano` (10x cheaper than `gpt-4o-mini`). All model names verified against current provider APIs.
- **Google deprecation warning** — Explicit callout that `text-embedding-004` is dead, use `gemini-embedding-001`.
- **Troubleshooting section added to README** — Covers the three most common failure modes: "No chunks" (wrong embedding model name), compaction model unreachable, server unreachable. Includes current model name table by provider.
- **Expected test output added to README** — Users can now see what a passing smoke test looks like before they run it.
- **Version bumped** — pyproject.toml synced to 2.3.2.

### Problem This Solves

Model names change without notice. A user following our docs could configure a dead model, get zero results from recall, and have no idea why. The troubleshooting section now explicitly warns about this and lists current model names by provider.

### Models Verified (April 2026)

| Provider | Embedding | Reasoning | Status |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Ollama | nomic-embed-text | qwen2.5:32b-instruct | Current |
| OpenAI | text-embedding-3-small | gpt-4.1-nano | Current |
| Google | gemini-embedding-001 | gemini-2.5-flash | Current (flash sunsets June 2026) |

## v2.3.1 — "Total Recall" (2026-04-08)

Documented auto-capture and added the `MNEMO_AUTO_CAPTURE` environment variable gate.

### What's New

- **Auto-Capture documentation** — New README section covering the two capture patterns (OpenClaw/Claude Code session watcher, Claude Desktop MCP bridge), quick start, and always-on configuration.
- **`MNEMO_AUTO_CAPTURE` env var** — Set to `true` and `mnemo-cortex start` automatically starts the session watcher. Default: off. No behavior change for existing users.

### Problem This Solves

Auto-capture has been working in production for weeks (CC watcher running 2+ weeks straight, zero failures) but wasn't documented anywhere in the public repo. New users had no idea the feature existed.

---

## v2.3.0 — "The Responsible Thing" (2026-04-07)

Pulled the Claude Desktop MCP bridge until Anthropic's new session storage architecture is supported.

### What Changed

- **Claude Desktop integration removed** — `integrations/claude-desktop/` pulled from the repo. The MCP tools (recall, search, save, startup, brain file read/write) worked correctly, but the automatic session watcher depended on Claude Desktop writing `.jsonl` files to `~/.config/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/`. Desktop v2.1.87+ ("cowork VM" architecture) moved session storage to internal IndexedDB/LevelDB. The watcher had nothing to watch.
- **README, CAPABILITIES, health output updated** — All references to the Desktop integration now include a notice explaining the pull and that Claude Code + OpenClaw integrations are unaffected.
- **mnemo-cortex-mcp repo unchanged** — The archived standalone repo already redirects here. Its README still points to this repo as the canonical source.

### Problem This Solves

Anyone following the Desktop setup docs would get a dead session watcher that silently captured nothing. Opie (our own Desktop agent) ran for 13 days with a broken watcher before we caught it. Rather than ship a known-broken integration, we pulled it.

### What's Next

The MCP server itself is fine — the 7 tools work. The gap is automatic session capture. Options being evaluated:
1. Read from Claude Desktop's new LevelDB/IndexedDB storage
2. MCP-only memory persistence (no file watcher needed)
3. Wait for Anthropic to expose a session export API

### Claude Code and OpenClaw users

Nothing changed for you. Your integrations work exactly as before.

---

## v2.2.0 — "One Repo, One Install" (2026-04-04)

Merged the MCP bridge (formerly mnemo-cortex-mcp) into the main repo. One product, one install.

### What's New

- **Built-in MCP bridge** — The Claude Desktop / Claude Code MCP server now lives at `integrations/claude-desktop/`. No separate repo needed. 7 tools: recall, search, save, startup, read/write/list brain files.
- **mnemo-cortex-mcp archived** — The old separate repo redirects here. All existing links still work.

### Problem This Solves

Users had to find and install two separate repos to get memory working. That's broken. Now it's one clone, one install.

### Migration

If you were using `mnemo-cortex-mcp` separately:
1. Pull the latest `mnemo-cortex`
2. Update your MCP config path: `mnemo-cortex-mcp/server.js` → `mnemo-cortex/integrations/claude-desktop/server.js`
3. Run `cd integrations/claude-desktop && npm install`

## v2.1.0 — "No Agent Runs Without Verified Memory" (2026-04-04)

Built-in deployment health verification. Auto-discovers agents, tests live recall, validates MCP configs, checks watchers.

### What's New

- **`mnemo-cortex health` command** — Comprehensive deployment health check that auto-discovers every agent from the database and runs live recall tests against each one. No hardcoded agent names.
- **MCP config validation** — `--check-mcp` flag verifies mnemo-cortex is registered as an MCP server in any config file (OpenClaw, Claude Desktop, etc). Catches the exact bug where an agent's MCP pipe is silently broken.
- **Watcher service monitoring** — Auto-discovers all mnemo-related systemd services and reports their status.
- **Multiple output modes** — `--json` for scripts/monitoring, `--quiet` for cron (exit code only), `--agents` for agent-only checks, `--services` for watcher-only checks.
- **CronAlarm integration** — Drop-in compatible with cron alerting. Non-zero exit on any failure.

### Problem This Solves

Rocky's Mnemo MCP tools were missing from his openclaw.json config. Nobody knew until Guy tried to use them — weeks later. This command catches that in 10 seconds, automatically, on a schedule.

### Usage

```
mnemo-cortex health                         # full check, human output
mnemo-cortex health --json                  # machine-readable for scripts
mnemo-cortex health --quiet                 # exit code only (for cron)
mnemo-cortex health --agents                # only test agent recall
mnemo-cortex health --services              # only check watcher services
mnemo-cortex health --check-mcp ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
mnemo-cortex health http://artforge:50001   # explicit server URL
```

### CronAlarm Example

```
0 */6 * * * mnemo-cortex health --quiet || cronalarm send "Mnemo health failed"
```

## v2.0.0 — "Don't Fear the /new!" (2026-03-17)

Ground-up rewrite. SQLite replaces JSONL. Proven on two live agents with six weeks of unbroken recall.

### What's New

- **SQLite + FTS5 storage** — All memory in a single database with full-text search. No more JSONL files. Fast, portable, zero dependencies.
- **Context frontier with active compaction** — Rolling window of messages + summaries. Older messages are automatically summarized, achieving ~80% token compression while preserving perfect recall.
- **DAG-based summary lineage with source expansion** — Every summary tracks which messages it was built from via a directed acyclic graph. The `summary_sources` table links condensed summaries back to their leaf summaries, creating full traceability from any summary to its original messages.
- **Verbatim replay mode** — Summaries are the default view, but any summary can be expanded back to the original messages for full-fidelity context.
- **OpenClaw session watcher daemon** — Lightweight sidecar that tails JSONL session files and ingests new messages into SQLite every 2 seconds. No hooks, no agent cooperation required.
- **Context refresher daemon** — Writes `MNEMO-CONTEXT.md` to the agent's workspace on a 5-second interval. The agent reads it at bootstrap for instant memory hydration.
- **Provider-backed summarization via OpenRouter** — Compaction summaries generated by Gemini 2.5 Flash via OpenRouter, with deterministic truncation fallback when no API key is available. No local GPU required.
- **Sidecar architecture** — Version-resistant design that observes session files from outside the agent. Mnemo keeps your memory on disk — if either process restarts, the data is already there.

### Live Deployment

Proven on two live OpenClaw agents:

- **Alice** (THE VAULT, Threadripper 3970X) — Running since early March 2026
- **Rocky** (IGOR, Ubuntu laptop) — Deployed March 17, 2026. 3,000+ messages ingested, 429+ summaries generated, 20+ conversations tracked. Recall to Day One.

### Breaking Changes

- v2.0 uses a completely new storage backend (SQLite) and does not share data with v1's JSONL/semantic cache system
- The v1 HTTP API (`/context`, `/preflight`, `/writeback`, `/ingest`) is still available via the FastAPI server but is no longer the primary integration path
- The recommended integration is now file-based: watcher daemon → SQLite → refresher daemon → `MNEMO-CONTEXT.md` → agent bootstrap
