# Mnemo Cortex — Hermes Agent Integration

Give [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) persistent
semantic memory that survives across sessions. Hermes already has its own
local memory (skills + FTS5 session search). Mnemo adds the cross-agent
shared layer — your Hermes instance can save memories that other agents
(another Hermes, a Claude Desktop user, an OpenClaw bot) read back.

> **Three lines:**
> Hermes remembers what one agent learned.
> Mnemo remembers what all your agents know.
> Hermes + Mnemo gives you both.

This integration uses Hermes's first-class MCP support (v0.12.0+) and the
Node stdio bridge that ships with `mnemo-cortex`. No custom Python, no
Hermes patching — config-only.

> **Verified working as of 2026-05-01** against `mnemo-cortex 2.6.5` and
> `hermes-agent v0.12.0`. End-to-end save+recall tested with
> `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free` via OpenRouter (recall worked
> first try) and Ollama-local `hermes3:8b` (save worked, recall flaky on
> 8B). agent_id privacy boundary verified at the Mnemo API level.

## What you need

- **Hermes Agent v0.12.0+** with Python 3.11 ([install guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart))
- **Node.js 18+** (the bridge is a Node stdio MCP server)
- **mnemo-cortex 2.6.5+** running somewhere reachable

## Install

### Quick path — run the installer

If you already have a Mnemo Cortex server running and Hermes installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GuyMannDude/mnemo-cortex.git
cd mnemo-cortex/integrations/hermes
bash install.sh
```

The installer prompts for your Mnemo URL, agent ID, and share mode, runs
`npm install` on the bridge, registers the `mnemo` MCP server with Hermes
via `hermes mcp add`, and verifies the wire with `hermes mcp test mnemo`.
Done.

If you don't have a Mnemo Cortex server yet, install it first:

```bash
pip install mnemo-cortex
mnemo-cortex init           # interactive — picks providers
mnemo-cortex start          # default port 50001
mnemo-cortex health         # verify it's up
```

Then run the installer above.

### Non-interactive / CI / curl-pipe path

The installer auto-detects when stdin isn't a TTY and switches to
non-interactive mode: prompts fall back to env vars or defaults, and the
"Enable all N tools?" confirmation from `hermes mcp add` is auto-accepted.

```bash
cd mnemo-cortex/integrations/hermes
MNEMO_URL=http://localhost:50001 \
MNEMO_AGENT_ID=hermes \
MNEMO_SHARE=separate \
bash install.sh < /dev/null
```

Env vars the installer honors:

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `MNEMO_URL` | `http://localhost:50001` | Where Mnemo Cortex is reachable |
| `MNEMO_AGENT_ID` | `hermes` | Per-agent memory namespace |
| `MNEMO_SHARE` | `separate` | `separate` / `always` / `never` |
| `MNEMO_REPLACE` | unset | Set to `1` to auto-replace an existing `mnemo` entry in Hermes config (otherwise the installer refuses rather than silently overwrite) |

Non-interactive mode refuses to install if Mnemo is unreachable
(`MNEMO_URL/health` must respond) — better to fail loud than wire Hermes
to a dead server.

### Manual path — for the curious or unusual setups

If you'd rather wire it up by hand (or the installer doesn't fit your
environment), here's what it does:

#### 1. Install the bridge

The bridge is a Node stdio MCP server bundled in the mnemo-cortex repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GuyMannDude/mnemo-cortex.git
cd mnemo-cortex/integrations/mcp-bridge
npm install
```

Two npm deps: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `zod`.

#### 2. Register with Hermes

Hermes ships with a built-in `mcp add` command. From anywhere on your shell:

```bash
hermes mcp add mnemo \
    --command node \
    --args /absolute/path/to/mnemo-cortex/integrations/mcp-bridge/server.js \
    --env MNEMO_URL=http://localhost:50001 MNEMO_AGENT_ID=hermes MNEMO_SHARE=separate
```

Replace the path with where you cloned the repo. Pick any `MNEMO_AGENT_ID`
you like — memories are scoped to it.

This writes the entry into Hermes's config file. With no profiles set up,
that's `~/.hermes/config.yaml`. If you use Hermes profiles, the entry
lands in `~/.hermes/profiles/<profile-name>/config.yaml` for the active
profile. Either way, if you'd rather edit by hand, see
[`config.yaml.example`](config.yaml.example) for the exact shape.

#### 3. Verify

```bash
hermes mcp test mnemo
```

You should see something like:

```
Testing 'mnemo'...

  passport_list_pending_observations    ...
  passport_promote_observation          ...
  passport_forget_or_override           ...
```

Restart Hermes (or just open a new conversation) and the tools are
available immediately.

## Tools you get

| Tool prefix | What it does | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `mnemo_*` (4 tools) | Save / recall / search / share memories | Always — Mnemo core |
| `passport_*` (5 tools) | Read and update the user's portable working-style profile | Always — Passport ships with Mnemo |
| `wiki_*` (3 tools) | Search and read static wiki pages (legacy WikAI) | Only when `WIKI_DIR` env is set and points to a real dir |
| Brain + session lifecycle (6 tools) | `agent_startup`, `opie_startup` (deprecated alias), `read_brain_file`, `write_brain_file`, `list_brain_files`, `session_end` | Only when `BRAIN_DIR` env is set |

So the minimum useful surface is **9 tools** (4 Mnemo + 5 Passport), and
**12 tools** if you have a wiki, **18 tools** if you have a brain *and* a
wiki.

## Choosing a model for Hermes

This integration is model-agnostic — Hermes picks the LLM, Mnemo provides
the memory. Three common configurations:

Hermes config uses three nested keys: `model.provider`, `model.base_url`,
`model.default`. API keys go in `~/.hermes/.env`.

### OpenRouter (verified working — recommended)

```bash
echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-..." >> ~/.hermes/.env
chmod 600 ~/.hermes/.env

hermes config set model.provider openrouter
hermes config set model.base_url https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
hermes config set model.default nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free
```

`nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free` is a free 120B Mixture-of-Experts
model with 12B active parameters — strong tool-use, good reasoning, and
zero cost. **This is the configuration verified to work end-to-end with
Mnemo's MCP tools as of 2026-05-01.** Other free options to try:
`meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free`, `google/gemma-3-27b-it:free`.

### Ollama (fully local, no key)

Hermes talks to Ollama's OpenAI-compatible API. **Hermes requires a model
with at least 64K context** — pulled models like `llama3.1:8b` (128K) work;
`qwen2.5:32b-instruct` (32K) is rejected at startup.

```bash
ollama serve &
ollama pull llama3.1:8b      # 128K context, tool-capable

# Hermes default base_url for "ollama" provider is localhost:11434/v1.
# Override only if Ollama runs elsewhere:
# export OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://other-host:11434/v1

hermes config set model.provider custom
hermes config set model.base_url http://localhost:11434/v1
hermes config set model.default llama3.1:8b
```

Tool-use note (empirical, 2026-05-01): 8B-class local models are
**borderline** for multi-tool sequences. `hermes3:8b` saved a memory via
`mnemo_save` first try, but went mute on the recall turn. `llama3.1:8b`
emitted the tool call as plain text instead of invoking it. For reliable
recall flows, prefer 30B+ tool-trained models or use OpenRouter Nemotron
above. Save-only flows tolerate smaller models.

When OPENAI_API_KEY isn't set, some clients reject the empty-key
handshake — set `OPENAI_API_KEY=ollama` (any non-empty string) in
`~/.hermes/.env` if you see authentication errors against Ollama.

### Direct API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, NVIDIA NIM, …)

```bash
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-..." >> ~/.hermes/.env
hermes config set model.provider anthropic
hermes config set model.default claude-haiku-4-5

# or
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." >> ~/.hermes/.env
hermes config set model.provider openai
hermes config set model.default gpt-4o-mini
```

See Hermes's full provider list at
<https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/configuration>.

## Memory hygiene

Hermes has its own built-in memory (skills, MEMORY.md, FTS5 session
search). Mnemo Cortex is *additive* — it doesn't replace Hermes's local
memory. The recommended setup:

- **Hermes local memory:** procedural (skills), recent context (FTS5
  search), user profile (Honcho)
- **Mnemo Cortex:** durable cross-session decisions, cross-agent shared
  knowledge, semantic recall over months of history

When you want Hermes to remember something across sessions or share it
with another agent, ask it to use `mnemo_save`. When you want to recall
something a different agent saved, ask it to use `mnemo_search` and
toggle `mnemo_share`.

## Cross-agent sharing

Default behavior (`MNEMO_SHARE: separate`) is privacy-first — your Hermes
instance only sees its own memories. To search across agents:

```
You: "What did the build agent save about last week's deploy issue?"
Hermes: [calls mnemo_share to enable cross-agent, then mnemo_search]
```

Or set `MNEMO_SHARE: always` in your config to skip the toggle. Set
`MNEMO_SHARE: never` to permanently lock the boundary.

## Curator interaction (Hermes v0.12.0+)

Hermes v0.12.0 added an autonomous "Curator" that runs on a 7-day cycle to
grade, consolidate, and archive **agent-created** skills in
`~/.hermes/skills/`. Per Hermes's own help text (`hermes curator --help`):

> Bundled and hub-installed skills are never touched. Archives are
> recoverable; auto-deletion never happens.

**Mnemo Cortex memory is outside the Curator's domain entirely.** Mnemo's
data lives in `~/.agentb/` (or wherever your `data_dir:` points), not in
`~/.hermes/skills/`. Saved memories survive Curator runs.

**MCP tools (Mnemo's `mnemo_save`/`recall`/etc., or any other server's
tools) are also outside the Curator's domain.** Tools register at MCP
discovery time and live as server-side handlers, not skill files. The
Curator can't see them, can't prune them, can't refactor them.

The only Curator interaction possible is: if Hermes auto-generates a
**skill** that wraps an MCP tool (e.g., promoting a successful "save my
weekly decisions" pattern into a reusable skill file), the Curator will
later grade that skill on the standard cycle:

- 7 days: graded against the rubric
- 30 days unused: marked stale
- 90 days unused: archived (recoverable, never deleted)

The underlying MCP tool keeps working regardless. Only the skill wrapper
is at risk, and "at risk" means archived-with-recovery, not deleted.

## Troubleshooting

### `hermes mcp test mnemo` says "✗ Connection failed"

Most common causes, in order:

1. **Mnemo isn't running.** Run `mnemo-cortex health` in another terminal
   — it should print a healthy JSON status. If it errors, start the
   server with `mnemo-cortex start`.
2. **Wrong path to `server.js`.** The path in `args:` must be absolute and
   point at the real file. Test with `node /your/path/server.js < /dev/null`
   — it should hang waiting for stdin (Ctrl+C to exit), not error.
3. **Bridge deps not installed.** `cd mnemo-cortex/integrations/mcp-bridge
   && npm install`.
4. **Wrong `MNEMO_URL`.** If your Mnemo runs on a non-default port, update
   the env. Check with `curl http://localhost:50001/health`.

### Tools list shows "Tools discovered: 9" instead of 12

You don't have a wiki dir. The bridge gracefully skips wiki tools when
`WIKI_DIR` is unset or points at a missing dir. This is normal — just
means the wiki integration isn't active for you. Ignore the count.

### Hermes connects but no `mcp_mnemo_*` tools appear in conversation

Hermes auto-injects MCP tools into every conversation, but the discovery
runs at startup. If you edited `~/.hermes/config.yaml` while Hermes was
running, restart it (`hermes` exits with Ctrl+D, then start again).

## What's next

- **Skills**: write a Hermes skill that wraps `mnemo_save` for your
  preferred memory format (decisions, lessons, contacts, etc.). See
  `skills/software-development/hermes-agent-skill-authoring/SKILL.md` in
  the Hermes repo.
- **Multi-agent**: install Mnemo + this integration on a second Hermes
  instance with a different `MNEMO_AGENT_ID`. With `MNEMO_SHARE: always`
  on the searcher, the second instance can recall what the first saved.
- **Brain repo**: set `BRAIN_DIR` to a [mnemo-plan](https://github.com/GuyMannDude/mnemo-plan)
  brain checkout. You get five extra tools (`read_brain_file`,
  `write_brain_file`, `list_brain_files`, `opie_startup`, `session_end`)
  for cross-session lane discipline. See [THE-LANE-PROTOCOL.md](https://github.com/GuyMannDude/mnemo-cortex/blob/master/THE-LANE-PROTOCOL.md).
