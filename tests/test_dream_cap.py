"""Dreamer overflow guards — the per-agent section cap + adaptive-halving backstop.

These are the two defenses v4.2.1 added so a single high-volume agent (opie's
auto-capture once hit ~19MB / ~4.9M tokens) can't 400 the whole nightly run.
They are *insurance*: in normal nightly operation each window is ~24h and stays
well under the cap, so the cap never fires — which is exactly why it needs a
test rather than waiting for the next stuck-window incident to exercise it.

  - _build_agent_section: bounds one agent's brief to MAX_AGENT_SECTION_CHARS,
    recency-first (drop oldest), announcing the drop (never silent truncation).
  - _call_openrouter_adaptive: belt-and-suspenders for token-density spikes —
    halve the input and retry on a context-length 400 (incl. the provider-side
    400 OpenRouter wraps in a 200), keeping the most-recent tail.
