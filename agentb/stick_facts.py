"""Cortex Stick facts channel — courier sync for the structured Facts store.

Memories and trajectories are files; facts are rows in {data_dir}/facts.sqlite,
so they can't ride the file-unit 3-way merge. Instead the stick carries a
canonical JSONL export (facts/facts.jsonl, encrypted like every other stick
file) and each host merges ROW-WISE under rules that mirror the FactsStore
promotion ladder:

  1. Same value on both sides → reassert: max confidence, newest timestamp.
  2. A NEWER confidence='false' row beats anything — demote() is an explicit
     judgment ("this is wrong") and must propagate; a STALE 'false' loses to
     a newer re-establishment.
  3. Otherwise the higher confidence rank wins (verified survives a newer
     high_probability challenge — the ladder's core promise), equal rank →
     newer last_updated, then value as a deterministic tie-break.

These rules are a total order per (entity, attribute), so the merge is
commutative and idempotent — no per-host base inventory is needed; the stick
simply holds the latest merged set. Facts are never deleted (demotion to
'false' IS the tombstone state), so there is no delete propagation and no
mass-delete guard to worry about.

Every change the courier applies to a host writes a fact_history audit row
(changed_by='stick:<id>') — the audit log is the loser preservation. History
itself stays local by design: each host's audit describes what happened THERE.

Clock-skew note: cross-machine last_updated comparisons assume NTP-sane
clocks. Within a confidence rank a skewed clock can pick the wrong winner
until the fact is re-asserted; it can never silently destroy the loser
(fact_history records it) and never beats a higher rank.
