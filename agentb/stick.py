"""Cortex Stick — USB courier sync between two full Mnemo installations.

The stick is NOT a server. Both machines run full Mnemo; the stick carries
the delta between them: memory JSONs, trajectory JSONLs, the brain git repo,
and a free-form project pad. Plug in → sync; pull out → carry → plug in →
the other machine catches up. No cloud, no VPN.

Constitutional principles (brain/cortex-stick-spec.md, carried over):
  P2 — sync the facts, not the geometry. Only truth files cross the stick.
       Vec indexes, caches, and sidecars are derived and rebuilt per-host.
  F-4 — data files → manifest LAST. The manifest write is the commit point;
        a torn generation is detected on mount and refused loudly.
  F-2/F-5 — per-host base inventories make every sync a 3-way merge; no
        silent overwrite, and "safe to remove" fires only after readback-
        verified hashes.
  #1121 — conflicts resolve deterministically, but the LOSER is preserved
        under state/conflicts/ on the stick, never silently destroyed.

Design note: this is a STATE-BASED sync. The stick keeps, per host, the
inventory both sides agreed on at last sync (relpath → sha256 + version).
Deletes are detected against that base — no tombstones, no record-schema
changes, works against any existing install.

# ── encryption (v1.1) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A lost stick must not be a lost fleet memory. Encryption is IN-TOOL, not
# volume-level: AES-256-SIV file crypto works identically on every OS Python
# runs on, keeps the stick FAT32/exFAT, needs no admin rights or drivers,
# and `stick watch` stays unattended. (BitLocker To Go can't be read on
# Linux, LUKS can't be read on Windows, VeraCrypt needs installs + manual
# mounts on both ends.)
#
# SIV mode is DETERMINISTIC: same key + same plaintext → same ciphertext.
# That is a deliberate trade — it leaks content *equality* (an acceptable
# leak next to the visible filenames), and in exchange the whole 3-way merge
# engine keeps working unchanged in ciphertext space: the host side hashes
# encrypt(plaintext) during scan, so host↔stick comparison, base inventories,
# the manifest, torn-generation detection, and `stick repair` all operate on
# ciphertext hashes. Repair and verify never need the key.
#
# The key is scrypt-derived from a passphrase and stored per-host under
# {data_dir}/stick-keys/ (0600) — NEVER on the stick. The stick's passport
# carries only the KDF salt/params and a key-check fingerprint so a wrong
# passphrase fails loud instead of writing garbage.
