"""Mnemo Cortex Trajectory Learning — Phase 1 (v4.5.0).

A native learning loop: agents capture the step-by-step recipe of a task that
went well (`mnemo_save_trajectory`) and recall proven recipes before a similar
task (`mnemo_recall_trajectory`). No external deps, no fine-tuning, no automatic
capture — agents explicitly save when they judge a task succeeded.

Storage mirrors the rest of Mnemo's "JSONL is disk truth, sqlite-vec is the
index" philosophy:

  - {agent_data_dir}/trajectories/{task_type}.jsonl
        Append-only, crash-safe source of truth. One JSON object per line, each
        with a UUID + timestamp. A torn final line (crash mid-write) is skipped
        on read, never corrupting earlier entries.
  - {agent_data_dir}/trajectories/traj_index.sqlite
        A VecStore (the same per-tenant sqlite-vec index used for memories) over
        each trajectory's embedding text, keyed by trajectory id. The embedding
        text is task_description + outcome + step actions; the task_type rides
        the index `category` column so recall can filter by task_type inside the
        kNN. Recall joins the vec hits back to the full JSONL records (which
        carry the step sequence, rating, and recency) and ranks them.

Phase-1 boundaries (Opie spec 2026-06-25): no export, no fine-tuning, no
automatic capture, no cross-agent sharing — each agent's trajectories are its
own under its agent data dir.
